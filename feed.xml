&lt;p&gt;I was reading about the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/09/3&quot;&gt;git security issue&lt;/a&gt;
this evening when I realized that upgrading the Windows version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chocolatey.org/&quot;&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; gave me a much newer version than the
Ubuntu version on WSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\&amp;gt;git --version
git version 2.30.2.windows.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this description of how to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://itsfoss.com/install-git-ubuntu/&quot;&gt;Install latest Git on Ubuntu-based Linux distributions&lt;/a&gt;
by adding a new Personal Package Archive (PPA) to your apt repository list that
tracks the latest version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have the latest version installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git --version

(both Surface Pro 4 and Surface Pro 5) for some years and regularly run into issues
where the SD card doesn’t stay connected. Randomly, it will disconnect and a few
seconds later reconnect. This is especially frustrating because I often host a
virtual disk image on the SD card and when it reconnects I have to manually
reconnect the virtual disk too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across an &lt;a href=&quot;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/all/sd-card-still-randomly-disconnects/e2f4b3f2-954b-4b1b-8a02-81029880edd0?auth=1#threadSummaryAnswersSection:~:text=Ran%20into%20the%20same%20problem%20regardless%20of%20SD%20card%20manufacturer&quot;&gt;old post&lt;/a&gt; with a similar issue on Surface Pro 3. I recall that
there have been a variety of SD card issues with SP3 over the years that didn’t
crop up with other editions, but I figured this was worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change is to switch from the RealTek driver to a generic USB driver as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press &lt;strong&gt;[Win]+X&lt;/strong&gt; then select &lt;strong&gt;Device Manager&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expand &lt;strong&gt;Universal Serial Bus Controller&lt;/strong&gt;, right-click on the &lt;strong&gt;RealTek USB 3.0 Card Reader&lt;/strong&gt; driver, then select &lt;strong&gt;Update Driver Software&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From the pop-up, select &lt;strong&gt;Browse my computer for driver software&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the next screen, select &lt;strong&gt;Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure Show compatible hardware is selected, then click on &lt;strong&gt;USB Mass Storage Device&lt;/strong&gt;, then click Next.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should say that Windows has successfully updated your driver software, so you can now click &lt;strong&gt;Close&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should be prompted to restart in order for the changes to take effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only just made this change a few days ago so I will see how it goes, but so far
I haven’t had any further disconnects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Adrian Bateman</name></author><summary type="html">I have been using a 128GB Micro-SD card as additional storage on my Surface Pro (both Surface Pro 4 and Surface Pro 5) for some years and regularly run into issues where the SD card doesn’t stay connected.

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to change the name your Windows PC uses for the Bluetooth device
without needing to change the way the PC name is reflected elsewhere. To do this,
use Device Manager and navigate to the Bluetooth radio adapter on your PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Properties for the Bluetooth Radio Adapter, on the Advanced tab, you
can edit the name that the PC device appears as over Bluetooth. Here, I was able
to change the name from all caps to a single capitalized word so that the
headphones will capture the new name and report it out correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

company be sued under the CCPA for failing to post a ‘do not sell my personal
information’ link?” To my surprise, the answer given was “No.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis in the post actually addressed the question of whether a consumer
could sue a company for failing to post the link, but it did not address who
else might have a cause of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-can-sue-under-the-ccpa&quot;&gt;Who can sue under the CCPA?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;amp;sectionNum=1798.150.&quot;&gt;§1798.150&lt;/a&gt; of the CCPA provides a cause of action for a data breach involving
disclosure of a consumer’s personal information because of a business’s
failure to implement reasonable security measures. This section allows
consumers to sue the business for damages after giving the business notice
and a chance to cure the issue if that is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;amp;sectionNum=1798.155.&quot;&gt;§1798.155&lt;/a&gt; of the CCPA allows the California Attorney
General to bring a civil action against a business.
This action can be brought for any violation of
the CCPA including a failure to post a ‘do not sell my personal information’
link if the business is required to provide one. Just like in the data breach
case, businesses have a chance to cure the issue after being notified of a
potential violation before an action can be commenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-vs-private-causes-of-action&quot;&gt;Public vs. Private Causes of Action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is a higher chance of being sued under a law that provides a
private cause of action, which allows anybody who is injured to sue you, than
there is under a public cause of action, which requires a public body such as
the state Attorney General to sue you. Government agencies only have so many
resources and they need to prioritize where they focus their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it seems irresponsible to suggest that a company cannot be sued
if they fail to post the required ‘do not sell my personal information’ link.
Depending upon the nature of the company, the type of information collected,
and the way in which it is being sold, a business might attract the attention
of the AG, and the penalties for intentionally violating the CCPA could be
large (up to $7,500 per violation, which could be per consumer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCPA comes into effect on January 1, 2020 and businesses that sell
personal information should provide a “clear and conspicuous link” titled
“Do Not Sell My Personal Information” on the homepage that California
consumers will see (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;amp;sectionNum=1798.135.&quot;&gt;§1798.135&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve found with Android). I had decided to back-up my phone, do a
factory reset and then restore things like photos and text
messages, but install the apps that I wanted from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed like Smart Switch was a good tool for this. One hiccup
was that the program doesn’t appear to have a way to do a partial
restore. I had backed up everything on my phone and, when I
did the restore, it put everything back the way it had been. Great
verification of the back-up/restore process but not exactly what I
wanted in this instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to do a new backup with only the data items that I wanted to
restore selected in the preferences. After a second factory reset,
this time the restore did exactly what I wanted and I set about
restoring the apps I use often from my Google Play store library.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Adrian Bateman</name></author><summary type="html">Samsung Smart Switch is a tool that will backup your phone and transfer the data to a new Samsung phone.
