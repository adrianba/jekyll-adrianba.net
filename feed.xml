that you will get an error from Windows Update: Error 8007000e Windows Update ran into a problem.
There are various guides on the web for how to recover from this but most of them didn’t work for
me. Here is what did work.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>On the Surface RT, I <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-a-usb-recovery-drive-460091d5-1e8f-cb33-2d17-8fdef77412d5">created a USB recovery drive</a> using the Recovery Drive app.
I used a 4GB USB drive and the tool formats the drive and copies the recovery files (uncheck the
checkbox for backing up files).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Download a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surface-recovery-image">Surface Recovery Image</a>
from Microsoft. If you type in your serial number, the site will provide the corresponding image
for Windows 8.1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extract all the files from the recovery image zip file onto the USB overwriting existing files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Power off the Surface RT. Insert the USB drive. Press and hold volume down, press the power button
to power on, and as soon as you see the Surface logo, release the volume down button. The Surface
should boot from the USB and under Advanced Options, you can reset from the drive. Choose to
repartition the drive to make sure everything is reset.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the point at which if you connect to the network, you will get the Windows Update error.
Instead, go through the OOBE but skip connecting to a network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Install the following updates in order (even though they are out of order - no other order worked
for me):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://download.windowsupdate.com/c/msdownload/update/software/crup/2014/02/windows8.1-kb2919442-arm_506ed7113697c597c2859d295d562fa4311834ec.msu">KB-2919442</a></li>

      <li>Reboot</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At this point, connect to Wi-Fi and search for updates in Windows Update. It takes a long time to
find any updates (maybe an hour or more) - just leave it. Then follow the instructions to install
the updates. This will take several hours to install &gt;100 updates.</li>

Recently, I have been using Docker running on a remote server accessed over SSH. When I tried to use the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker">Docker extension</a> for VSCode, I would get an error message saying: “In order to use an SSH DOCKER_HOST, you must configure an ssh-agent.  Source: Docker (Extension)”.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uploads/2022/must-configure-ssh-agent.png" alt="Screen shot of VSCode error message" /></p>

<p>One of the easiest ways to ensure that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-agent</code> is running is to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keychain</code>.</p>

<p>To install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keychain</code>, use:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt install keychain
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you need to edit your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code> file to include the following line:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>eval `keychain -q --eval --agents ssh IDLIST`
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Replace <em>IDLIST</em> with the list of identity files in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh</code> folder.</p>

<p>For example, in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code> file I have the line:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>eval `keychain -q --eval --agents ssh id_rsa id_ed25519`
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, each time you open a shell, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keychain</code> will check if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-agent</code> is running and if not start it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Adrian Bateman</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often use Visual Studio Code together with WSL2 using the Remote - WSL extension.

(both Surface Pro 4 and Surface Pro 5) for some years and regularly run into issues
where the SD card doesn’t stay connected. Randomly, it will disconnect and a few
seconds later reconnect. This is especially frustrating because I often host a
virtual disk image on the SD card and when it reconnects I have to manually
reconnect the virtual disk too.</p>

<p>I came across an <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/all/sd-card-still-randomly-disconnects/e2f4b3f2-954b-4b1b-8a02-81029880edd0?auth=1#threadSummaryAnswersSection:~:text=Ran%20into%20the%20same%20problem%20regardless%20of%20SD%20card%20manufacturer">old post</a> with a similar issue on Surface Pro 3. I recall that
there have been a variety of SD card issues with SP3 over the years that didn’t
crop up with other editions, but I figured this was worth a try.</p>

<p>The change is to switch from the RealTek driver to a generic USB driver as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Press <strong>[Win]+X</strong> then select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li>
  <li>Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus Controller</strong>, right-click on the <strong>RealTek USB 3.0 Card Reader</strong> driver, then select <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.</li>
  <li>From the pop-up, select <strong>Browse my computer for driver software</strong>.</li>
  <li>On the next screen, select <strong>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</strong>.</li>
  <li>Make sure Show compatible hardware is selected, then click on <strong>USB Mass Storage Device</strong>, then click Next.</li>
  <li>It should say that Windows has successfully updated your driver software, so you can now click <strong>Close</strong>.</li>
  <li>You should be prompted to restart in order for the changes to take effect.</li>
</ol>

company be sued under the CCPA for failing to post a ‘do not sell my personal
information’ link?” To my surprise, the answer given was “No.”</p>

<p>The analysis in the post actually addressed the question of whether a consumer
could sue a company for failing to post the link, but it did not address who
else might have a cause of action.</p>

<h2 id="who-can-sue-under-the-ccpa">Who can sue under the CCPA?</h2>

<p><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;sectionNum=1798.150.">§1798.150</a> of the CCPA provides a cause of action for a data breach involving
disclosure of a consumer’s personal information because of a business’s
failure to implement reasonable security measures. This section allows
consumers to sue the business for damages after giving the business notice
and a chance to cure the issue if that is possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;sectionNum=1798.155.">§1798.155</a> of the CCPA allows the California Attorney
General to bring a civil action against a business.
This action can be brought for any violation of
the CCPA including a failure to post a ‘do not sell my personal information’
link if the business is required to provide one. Just like in the data breach
case, businesses have a chance to cure the issue after being notified of a
potential violation before an action can be commenced.</p>

<h2 id="public-vs-private-causes-of-action">Public vs. Private Causes of Action</h2>

<p>Of course, there is a higher chance of being sued under a law that provides a
private cause of action, which allows anybody who is injured to sue you, than
there is under a public cause of action, which requires a public body such as
the state Attorney General to sue you. Government agencies only have so many
resources and they need to prioritize where they focus their efforts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it seems irresponsible to suggest that a company cannot be sued
if they fail to post the required ‘do not sell my personal information’ link.
Depending upon the nature of the company, the type of information collected,
and the way in which it is being sold, a business might attract the attention
of the AG, and the penalties for intentionally violating the CCPA could be
large (up to $7,500 per violation, which could be per consumer).</p>

<p>The CCPA comes into effect on January 1, 2020 and businesses that sell
personal information should provide a “clear and conspicuous link” titled
“Do Not Sell My Personal Information” on the homepage that California
