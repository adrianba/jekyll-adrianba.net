about 20 seconds. That reset got my keyboard working again.&lt;/p&gt;

phone. You also use it to backup your phone to your PC in case you need to restore it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00048603/&quot;&gt;Samsung Smart Switch for Mac or PC&lt;/a&gt;
on the Samsung site. The PC version has a dependency on some relatively old versions of the Visual
C++ runtime, which you may not have installed on a newer PC running Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to install both the x86 and x64 versions of the runtime:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582&quot;&gt;Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had managed to install enough apps on my phone that some of them
were causing some performance problems (one of the challenges
I’ve found with Android). I had decided to back-up my phone, do a
factory reset and then restore things like photos and text
messages, but install the apps that I wanted from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed like Smart Switch was a good tool for this. One hiccup
was that the program doesn’t appear to have a way to do a partial
restore. I had backed up everything on my phone and, when I
did the restore, it put everything back the way it had been. Great
verification of the back-up/restore process but not exactly what I
wanted in this instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to do a new backup with only the data items that I wanted to
restore selected in the preferences. After a second factory reset,
this time the restore did exactly what I wanted and I set about
restoring the apps I use often from my Google Play store library.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Adrian Bateman</name></author><summary type="html">Samsung Smart Switch is a tool that will backup your phone and transfer the data to a new Samsung phone.

install some packages from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; I got the following network error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;request to https://registry.npmjs.org/XXX failed, reason: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN registry.npmjs.org:443
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;XXX&lt;/code&gt; was the name of the package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was running bash from Ubuntu using WSL but when I switched to a Windows command prompt and ran the Windows install of node/npm then it connected just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a little searching around but I discovered that this was most likely to do with the network proxy we have at Microsoft or some other quirk of the network configuration. We are currently testing a new on-demand VPN configuration, which had connected me to the corporate network even though I was actually attached directly. Disconnecting the VPN made things “just work” so I guess there was some kind of networking loop that Windows native networking could figure out since it has my login credentials whereas Ubuntu couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EAI_AGAIN&lt;/code&gt; error is a transient failure and is probably related to something you can fix about your network config.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Adrian Bateman</name></author><summary type="html">This morning I was experimenting with some demo code and when I tried to install some packages from npm I got the following network error:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Using Microsoft Flow to publish medium.com recommendations</title><link href="https://adrianba.net/2016/09/24/using-microsoft-flow-to-publish-medium-com-recommendations/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Using Microsoft Flow to publish medium.com recommendations" /><published>2016-09-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-24T12:01:17-07:00</updated><id>https://adrianba.net/2016/09/24/using-microsoft-flow-to-publish-medium-com-recommendations</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://adrianba.net/2016/09/24/using-microsoft-flow-to-publish-medium-com-recommendations/">&lt;p&gt;Like a growing number of people, I read a lot of content on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/&quot;&gt;medium.com&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of weeks I’ve been playing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://flow.microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Microsoft Flow&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to create automated workflows between different apps and services. I’m not on the Flow team - I just think the service is interesting, especially now that it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/available-for-everyone/&quot;&gt;available for everyone&lt;/a&gt; to use. It reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes&quot;&gt;Yahoo Pipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tweeting out recommended reading from medium.com is very simple using Flow. Medium has an RSS feed with a list of your recommendations at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/feed/@_your-medium-id_/has-recommended&lt;/code&gt;. You can create a new Flow trigger from this RSS feed so that new entries cause the flow to run. By adding Post a tweet action, you can cause the new entry to post to Twitter. You can use data from the RSS field to populate the tweet. I post the URL and the title of the recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. I saved the flow with my Twitter credentials and now whenever I click the recommended button on a medium.com post, I tweet about it within a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Adrian Bateman</name></author><summary type="html">Like a growing number of people, I read a lot of content on medium.com.

The genius thing about Yeoman is that, by itself, it doesn’t know how to do anything. This flexibility comes from a modular approach that relies on separate generator modules. Each &lt;a href=&quot;http://yeoman.io/generators/&quot;&gt;generator&lt;/a&gt; knows how to create a particular kind of project (e.g. an Backbone.js app or a Chrome extension).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/respec/&quot;&gt;ReSpec&lt;/a&gt; is a JS library written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robinberjon&quot;&gt;Robin Berjon&lt;/a&gt; that makes it easier to write technical specifications, or documents that tend to be technical in nature in general. It was originally designed for the purpose of writing W3C specifications, but has since grown to be able to support other outputs as well. On of the best things about ReSpec is its intrinsic understanding of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/respec/guide.html#webidl-support&quot;&gt;WebIDL&lt;/a&gt;. You can outline the design for a new API and it makes it very easy to fill in the description of what the methods and properties do. It also makes it easy to refer to other specs using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.specref.org/&quot;&gt;SpecRef database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing these two together, I have create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-respec&quot;&gt;Yeoman generator called generator-respec&lt;/a&gt; that outputs a basic ReSpec document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you already have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; installed, you can install Yeoman with the command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install –g yo&lt;/code&gt;. After that you should install the ReSpec generator with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install –g generator-respec&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have the tools installed, create a new folder to hold your specification and from the command prompt in that directory run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yo respec&lt;/code&gt;. This will prompt you for a title, short-name, spec status, and author information and then create a new index.html document with an outline specification using ReSpec. From here you can edit your spec using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/respec/guide.html&quot;&gt;ReSpec documentation&lt;/a&gt; as a guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current implementation of generator-respec is very basic. I’m sure there are some obvious things that can be added. One idea I have is to support a subgenerator that creates related specs in the same folder. What else should be added? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adrianba/generator-respec&quot;&gt;generator-respec project is available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Adrian Bateman</name></author><summary type="html">Yeoman is a tool that provides a scaffolding system to begin new projects. The genius thing about Yeoman is that, by itself, it doesn’t know how to do anything. This flexibility comes from a modular approach that relies on separate generator modules. Each generator knows how to create a particular kind of project (e.g. an Backbone.js app or a Chrome extension).</summary></entry></feed>
