I've been running
[MaxiVista](http://www.maxivista.com/) for a while now.
For the few not in the know, this application allows you to use the
screen on other computers to appear as an additional video adapter
so you can extend your desktop across the network.

For example, I have two laptops on my desk: the main one that
I'm using to type this, and an older one that, amongst other
things, has a different build environment. The old one sits unused
most of the time so using MaxiVista, I can use it as an additional
screen. To be honest, I'm not really into multi-screen PCs that
much so this is an ideal solution because I'm not wasting space
with a second monitor but it's there when I really do need it.
Right now I have a Remote Desktop session into a server in our lab
on the second screen - it is great for this.

Amongst the features in the
[new version of
MaxiVista](http://www.maxivista.com/new.htm) is the ability to use the keyboard and mouse of the
primary PC to control the secondary PC, sort of like a software KVM
switch. I was using a different application to achieve that before
but this is much smoother. It also transfers clipboard contents so
you can cut and paste between computers.

Anyway, check out the new version - highly recommended.
