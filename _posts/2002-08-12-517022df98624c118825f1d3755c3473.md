[Caching
with .NET Using Interfaces](http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/2002/08/08.html#a936).
[Builder.com](http://builder/com) has another
[
decent .NET article on Caching](http://builder.com.com/article.jhtml?id=u00220020806lur01.htm). You can take a variety of
approaches to caching with .NET, including using the built-in
cache. For additional flexibility, try developing your own cache
using advanced expiration techniques.
