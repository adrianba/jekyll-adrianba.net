I
[
mentioned a couple of weeks ago](/2004/04/25/d6304e81674e4ee78bd56f20013dce62) that, in common with others in
the blog community, I was trying out David Allen's GTD
methodology.

With a few days left on the trial version, I've parted with the
cash to buy the
[
GTD add-in for Outlook](http://www.davidco.com/productDetail.php?id=63&IDoption=20). It has made a real difference ensuring
that I keep a consistent view of all my outstanding tasks and
making it easy to turn e-mail messages into _appropriate_
tasks.

After two weeks, I can still see my desk, the floor surrounding
my desk, and I don't have half-read mail scattered around the
house: everything is either done with or sitting in my pending tray
with an associated Outlook task. I've long been a proponent of the
phrase "you gotta have a system" but, until this, I hadn't found a
workable system.

I may be speaking too soon (I've only been following this regime
for a short time) but I'm hoping it will stick. I already feel more
organised!
