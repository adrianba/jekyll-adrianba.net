There were a number of announcements at TechEd US last week with many status updates on forthcoming products. Bruce Kyle has written up the list on the [US ISV DE blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/usisvde/archive/2009/05/15/roadmaps-for-major-products-announced-at-teched.aspx). Itâ€™s interesting to see the ramp-up for Windows Mobile 6.5 beginning with the launch of registration for the [Windows Marketplace for Mobile](http://developer.windowsmobile.com/Marketplace.aspx) and an [announcement](http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsmobile/archive/2009/03/18/windows-mobile-6-5-what-s-in-for-developers.aspx) of support for the latest draft of the [W3C Widgets](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets/) spec. In fact, there is a [Windows Mobile Ramp-Up](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/rampup/dd807370.aspx) track on MSDN to facilitate learning about mobile development.

 

One aspect Iâ€™m particularly interested in exploring is the Windows 7 native support for the [ribbon UI](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ScenicRibbon). This is something Iâ€™ve been investigating for a while for a side project and so Iâ€™m considering limiting myself to Windows 7 for now so I can take advantage of this control. As I understand it, [the plan is to provide support for Windows Vista](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd371191(VS.85).aspx) around the time of Windows 7 RTM.
