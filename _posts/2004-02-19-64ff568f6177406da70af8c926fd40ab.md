Michael Platt](http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_platt/archive/2004/02/05/67908.aspx): _I have done a ton of interviewing of
architects and typically look for this simulated annealing in their
problem solving approach using a number of architectural problems
that I have come across that cannot be solved by [divide and
conquer] (in fact make the problem worse). One of my favourite non
technical interview questions is very simple and designed to see
how people analyse problems. Their response allows you to
categorise them roughly into mathematical, logical or analytical
thinkers. Developers tend to be logical, architects tend to be
analytical, I not sure what the mathematicians are!_ ...
_Here's the question if you want to see what you are:_

_I have a cup of coffee and a cup of tea. I take a teaspoon
full of coffee and put it in the tea. I then take a teaspoon of the
tea and put it in the coffee. Which is the purest, the coffee or
the tea? Explain your thinking._

Well, I went for the mathematical approach. Not sure what that
means.
