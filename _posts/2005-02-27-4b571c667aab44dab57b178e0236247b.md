In my
[
last post](/2005/02/26/9cb90c98cf13431c93febde1b29eb294), I described how .NET 2.0 will check your web
services for conformance to the Basic Profile (v1.0 in Beta 1 and
v1.1 from Beta 2 onwards). When you create a web service client
proxy using WSDL.EXE, the service is also checked for BP
compliance. If I generate a proxy for my simple non-compliant web
service then I get the following output:
    
    
    C:>wsdl /o:simpleproxy.cs http://localhost/simple.asmx
    Microsoft (R) Web Services Description Language Utility
    [Microsoft(R) .NET Framework, Version 2.0.40607.85]
    Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
    
    Warning: This web reference does not conform to WS-I Basic Profile v1.0.
    R2706: A wsdl:binding in a DESCRIPTION MUST use the value of "literal" for
    the use attribute in all soapbind:body, soapbind:fault, soapbind:header and
    soapbind:headerfault elements.
    - Operation 'Hello' on binding 'SimpleServiceSoap' from namespace 'urn:simple'.
    
    Writing file 'simpleproxy.cs'.
    
    C:>
    

The generated proxy will still work as normal to communicate
with the web service if possible. The message is just a warning for
your information, which you may communicate to the web service
author. Clients generated with WSDL.EXE will always be BP compliant
unless something appears in the service's WSDL that prevents this
(for example using SOAP encoding).
