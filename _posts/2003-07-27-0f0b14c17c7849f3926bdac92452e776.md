<blockquote>_If you're using V1.1.4322 of the frameworks, and you're
writing unit tests using NUnit 2.0, you'll need to add the
following to both the nunit-console.exe.config and
nunit-gui.exe.config files:_
>     
>     
>     <startup>
>       <supportedRuntime version="v1.1.4322" /> 
>     </startup>
>

> _NUnit 2.0 is compiled against V1.0 of the frameworks, and at
some point you'll wind up trying to load both V1.0 and V1.1
versions of mscorlib.dll, which is prohibited by the CLR. By adding
this to your application's configuration files, you'll force the
NUnit test harness code to run under V1.1 of the frameworks,
thereby solving your problem without forcing you to recompile the
NUnit binaries._

Hmmm...should probably have thought about this before I charged
off and rebuilt the binaries using 1.1...
