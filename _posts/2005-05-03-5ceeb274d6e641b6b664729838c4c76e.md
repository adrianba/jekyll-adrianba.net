A few weeks ago, I wrote about the
[
Basic Profile support in ASP.NET Web Services](/2005/02/26/9cb90c98cf13431c93febde1b29eb294) (ASMX) with .NET
2.0. Since then, Beta 2 has been released changing the details
slightly.

Beta 2 incorporates support for the
[Basic
Profile v1.1](http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicProfile-1.1.html) (Beta 1 supported v1.0). The syntax for declaring
that your web service conforms to BP1.1 has changed slightly
(different property and enum names).
    
    
    <%@ WebService Language="C#" Class="SimpleService" %>
    
    using System.Web.Services;
    using System.Web.Services.Protocols;
    
    [WebService(Namespace="urn:simple")]
    <span style="background-color:yellow">[WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo=WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1,EmitConformanceClaims=true)]</span>
    public class SimpleService {
    
            [WebMethod]
            public string Hello(string s) {
                    return string.Format("Hello, {0}!",s);
            }
    
    }
    

The EmitConformanceClaims property now causes the following
claim to be included in the WSDL:
    
    
    <wsdl:documentation><br><wsi:Claim conformsTo="http://ws-i.org/profiles/basic/1.1" xmlns:wsi="http://ws-i.org/schemas/conformanceClaim/" 
    /> <br></wsdl:documentation>
    

According to the [WS-I site](http://www.ws-i.org/),
"The Basic Profile 1.1 is derived from the Basic Profile 1.0 by
incorporating to-date errata and removing to the Simple SOAP
Binding Profile those requirements related to the serialization of
envelopes and their representation in messages."
