Today I finally got fed up with writing all those repeated
properties for XML serialization and data binding. I decided that I
couldn't wait for code expansions in Whidbey:

[QuickCode
.NET](http://quickcode.dvxp.com/en/QuickCode.aspx) is a Visual Studio add-in that allows you to type short
phrases like `prop int test` and press Alt+Q to expand
this into a getter/setter property. It is completely configurable
so that you can modify the built-in expansions to your coding style
and create new snippets as you like.

It is only US$29 and with today's exchange rate that makes it
pretty darned cheap in my book.
