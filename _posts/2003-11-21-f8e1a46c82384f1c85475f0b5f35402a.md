If you install IIS6 on a Win2K3 server before promoting the
server to be a domain controller using dcpromo, some IIS
permissions don't get upgraded correctly:

  * [
332097 - IIS 6.0: DCPROMO Does Not Retain Permissions on Some IIS
Folders](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;332097)
  * [823379
- "Server Error in '/' Application. Access to the Path <Path>
Is Denied" Error Message When You Try to Log On to Windows
SharePoint Services](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=823379)
