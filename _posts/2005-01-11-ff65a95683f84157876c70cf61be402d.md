There are a couple of good articles about SQL tracing in the
MSDN SQL Server Developer Center pulled from SQL Server
Professional magazine.

[
Trace-scrubbing Tools](http://msdn.microsoft.com/sql/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnsqlpro04/html/sp04j1.asp) and
[
OpenSQLTrace: Automated Trace Processing and Analysis System](http://msdn.microsoft.com/sql/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnsqlpro04/html/sp04k12.asp)
discuss how to trace, scrub, and analyse data about the
transactions occurring in SQL to identify possibly troublesome
operations.
