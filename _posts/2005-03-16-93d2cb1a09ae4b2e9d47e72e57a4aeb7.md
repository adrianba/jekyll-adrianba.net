The **Avalon and Indigo Community Technology Preview -
March 05** is now available to MSDN subscribers (Tools,
Platform Tools, WinFX SDK).

"Avalon" is the code name for Microsoftâ€™s unified
presentation subsystem for Windows, consisting of a display engine
and a managed-code framework. It unifies how Windows creates,
displays, and manipulates documents, media, and user interface, and
enables developers and designers to create visually-stunning,
differentiated user experiences.

"Indigo" is the code name for Microsoftâ€™s new
Service-oriented communications infrastructure built on top of web
services protocols. The advanced web service support in "Indigo"
provides interoperable secure, reliable, and transacted
messaging.
