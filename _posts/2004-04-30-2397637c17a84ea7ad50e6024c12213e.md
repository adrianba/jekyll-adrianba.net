Despite the work going into Whidbey and the associated growth in
the .NET Framework, today we're developing against .NET 1.1 and it
doesn't support everything yet.

That said, there is a lot that it does do and the
[
Win32 to .NET API Map](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/win32map.asp) is good for pointing out where to look in
the framework for experienced Win32 devs.

If the framework doesn't provide what you want then you can head
off to [pinvoke.net](http://pinvoke.net/) to get details
of how to call various Win32 and other unmanaged APIs rather than
trying to figure it out yourself over and over.
