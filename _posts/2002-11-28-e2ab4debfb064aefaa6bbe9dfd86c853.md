ILLINK -- Microsoft (R) .NET Framework IL Linker](http://www.gotdotnet.com/userarea/filedetails.aspx?FileName=illink.zip)

The ILLINK utility is intended for linking multiple managed
modules or assemblies into a single module or assembly. The utility
relies on round-tripping using the ILASM and ILDASM utilities and
is not able to link the modules containing embedded native code.
Only pure-IL modules, such as those generated by C#, VB.NET or
ILASM compilers, can be linked.

The general principle of the ILLINK functioning is the
corrective round-tripping. The modules being linked are
disassembled into IL Assembly language source text, the text is
processed and then re-assembled into a single module.
