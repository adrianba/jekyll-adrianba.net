[Andrew
Cencini](http://sqljunkies.com/WebLog/acencini/articles/716.aspx): _In this article, I will not focus as much on the
fairly extensive 'baggage' that is involved in supporting the
IFilter interface (there are many approaches to hooking the various
pieces together), but rather, Iâ€™ll spend more time explaining
how to get everything working so you can experiment further with
your IFilters and fine-tune the techniques employed to make these
components available in C#. [via

I've worked on writing managed components supporting IFilter in
order to process metadata into Microsoft Index Server for querying
both as part of a full text search and an extensible data store.
This is one of the things that I hope WinFS will improve but for
now this is a good example as an introduction to IFilter.
