<blockquote>[_
Smartphone_](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/02/15.html#a1022)_. .......having the ability to leverage my
development skills as well as code I've already written on to the
phone is a tremendous plus for me.
[_[_The
Furrygoat Experience_](http://www.furrygoat.com/archives/000265.html)_] Well yeah, except that I don't
know anyone who does windows development without one or more
frameworks (MFC, ATL, Atila, WTL), none of which you get with
Smartphone, just raw API's, very 1990's !._

[ported](http://www.smartphonedn.com/articles/wtl_port.html)
