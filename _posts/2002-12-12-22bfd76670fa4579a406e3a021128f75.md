The
[
XML Documentation Tool](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvssamp/html/vbcs_XMLComments.asp)
([
XML Documentation Tool.exe](http://download.microsoft.com/download/visualbasic.net/sample95/1.0/NT45XP/EN-US/XMLComments.exe)) gives Visual Basic .NET developers
the ability to author XML documentation files for their library
projects.  This is useful when it is desirable to distribute a
built assembly but impractical to distribute associated source
code.  Consumers of their referenced libraries see the XML
information in Intellisense in the Visual Studio code editor and
the Object Browser.

<blockquote>**Note`   `**The tool can
be used for assemblies built in languages other than Visual Basic
.NET, as long as the assemblies are CLS compliant managed code
assemblies, such as C#.</blockquote>
