<blockquote>_Also re-visited my trusty stack of_[_Gerald
Weinberg's_](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?GeraldWeinberg)_"_[_Quality Software Management_](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?QualitySoftwareManagement)_" books (all 4
volumes).  If you're a developer who is constantly trying to
understand why people in bad situations constantly do stupid things
("The project is late! We'll fix that by adding more people!"), you
owe it to yourself to read his books.  I think Jerry's work is
timeless, and you shouldn't overlook that fact that modern
"luminaries" in software development techniques derive a LOT of
their work from Jerry's work.
