[
dotMSN is a class library to make use of the MSN Messenger
Service](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Code/2002/July/dnMsn.asp). The library is built in C# and can therefore be used
by all languages the .NET environment supports.

I gave up on my implementation of something like this. Too many
other people were doing the same thing and I didn't really have
enough time in the end either to help (or compete!).
