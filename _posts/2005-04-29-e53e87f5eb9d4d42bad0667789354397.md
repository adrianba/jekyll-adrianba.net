ZDNet reports that
[
some attendees at the Infosecurity Europe conference think the
email virus' heyday is over](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/security/0,39020375,39196727,00.htm). This is an interesting observation
and one I've noted just this week.

Much of my personal e-mail is delivered through a service with
mail filtering outsourced to
[Postini](http://www.Postini.com/). Here, unwanted mail
is blocked on the server and identified as either containing a
virus or being spam. Every few days I sign in to check that there
are no false positives (usually mail that could be regarded as spam
but that I might want to read anyway) and to delete the junk. I've
noticed that the red list of mails with a virus has diminished
drastically in recent weeks while the amount of spam has remained
fairly constant.
