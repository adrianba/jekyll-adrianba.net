Clearing out my loft I came across my collection of Sinclair paraphernalia. I worked my way up through the Sinclair systems, ZX-81, ZX-Spectrum and ultimately a Sinclair QL, all of which I still own. Bizarrely, since I can't remember when, I must have acquired a second ZX-81 because I find I now have two. I also discovered a small selection of Sinclair related magazines and, after a quick search on the web, ran into this fab web site: [The Your Sinclair Rock 'n' Roll Years](http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/), complete with [video montage of the history of the Spectrum](http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/tvprog/downloads.htm), etc. This is awesome!
