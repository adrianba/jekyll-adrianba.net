[Keith Brown](http://www.pluralsight.com/keith/) sent
out this interesting tip:

<blockquote>_You can delete autocomplete items in Office and IE
by holding the mouse down on the item that's getting in the way
while the autocomplete listbox is down (you can force it to drop
down in an empty field by clicking that field a couple times if
necessary) and pressing DEL._</blockquote>

<blockquote>_I'm loving this feature - I just used it to delete
some old addresses from my TO: autocomplete in
Outlook._</blockquote>
