Scott Swigart](http://radiocomments2.userland.com/comments?u=117167&p=400&link=http%3A%2F%2Fradio.weblogs.com%2F0117167%2F2003%2F07%2F24.html%23a400): _Also, yes, VB existed before .NET, but I
don't see what's muddled about the language. If you want to see a
kludge, look at what happened to C when it turned into
C++._

How about the way that VB uses () for both array syntax and
calling constructors so that when I type `New
MyObject(3)` I have to add braces to indicate that I meant an
array not passing 3 to a constructor?

All languages have their foibles, but after using VB.NET more
during the last few weeks, it does seem to suffer from more
arbitrary grammar decisions than most.
