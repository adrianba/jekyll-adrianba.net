ASP.NET Web Services with .NET 2.0 will include testing for
Basic Profile compliance. In the mean time, the WS-I has
[
testing tools](http://ws-i.org/deliverables/workinggroup.aspx?wg=testingtools) written in both C# and Java to help developers
determine whether their Web services are conformant with WS-I
profile guidelines.
