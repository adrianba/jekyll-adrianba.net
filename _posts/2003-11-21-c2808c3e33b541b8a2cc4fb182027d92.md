(Via [Mike Gunderloy](http://www.larkware.com/) on
[
win_tech_off_topic](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/23719) - this tool is pointed to on the
[
MSDN subscriptions FAQ page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/faq/default.asp#subdwnld) - click on "What are ISO image
files and how do I use them?" and the link is near the bottom of
that section.)
