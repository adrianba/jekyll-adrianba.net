There's lots going on in the web standards world and being part of the Internet Explorer team gives me a front row seat. We've posted a few updates on the IE Blog relating to standards in the last few weeks:

 

  
  * [W3C SVG Working Group Update for January 2010](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2010/02/01/w3c-svg-working-group-update-for-january-2010.aspx)
   
  * [MIX - Microsoft, W3C and SVG](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2010/02/22/mix-microsoft-w3c-and-svg.aspx)
   
  * [Documenting Standards in IE](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2010/02/24/documenting-standards-in-ie.aspx)
   
  * [W3C HTML Working Group Publishes New Drafts](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2010/03/05/W3C-HTML-Working-Group-Publishes-New-Drafts.aspx)
   
  * [Working with the HTML5 Community](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2010/03/09/Working-with-the-HTML5-Community.aspx)
 

I'm really looking forward to the feedback we get from [MIX](http://live.visitmix.com/News/Internet-Explorer-9-at-MIX10) where General Manager of IE, Dean Hachamovitch, will present one of the [keynote sessions](http://live.visitmix.com/News/MIX10-Keynotes-Interviews-and-Sessions-Online) and there will be a number of IE9 [breakouts](http://live.visitmix.com/Sessions#/tags/InternetExplorer). Unfortunately, I won't get a chance to be at MIX this year but I'll be watching from afar and waiting to hear the stories my colleagues have to tell when they return.
