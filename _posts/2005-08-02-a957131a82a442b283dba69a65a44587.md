Now that we've released
[IE7
Beta 1](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/IE/ie7/default.mspx) to a developer audience,
[Markus
posted](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/07/31/445778.aspx) about the improvements we've made in printing. He's
written up a good overview and I just want to emphasise what you'll
probably see highlighted most everywhere about both IE7 Beta 1 and
Windows Vista Beta 1: this is just the beginning.

We want to hear feedback about the changes we've made in Beta 1
but I'm also looking forward to when we can show off the further
improvements we've made since then. Hopefully, with the new print
template in place fitting content to the page width, there's a
corner of a forest somewhere breathing a sigh of relief.
