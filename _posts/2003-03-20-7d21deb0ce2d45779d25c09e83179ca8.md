[Magic, The User Inteface
Library for .NET](http://www.dotnetmagic.com/)

<blockquote>The .NET Framework contains a wide range of user interface
controls, but they offer only a basic look and feel. Today's user
expects a richer experience that you just cannot build with the
out-of-the-box controls.
> 
> The Magic Library aims to solve this by providing a set of user
interface elements that add the sophistication expected from modern
Windows applications.
> 
> The library can be used from any managed .NET language such as
C# and VB.NET and comes with full source code, sample applications,
documentation and a signed assembly.
> 
> You can include the Magic Library in your own private or
commerical applications free of charge. See the _readme.html_
in the download for full license terms.
