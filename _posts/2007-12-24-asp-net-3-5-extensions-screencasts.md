Scott Hanselman is working on a series of screencasts demonstrating the new features of the [ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions](http://www.asp.net/Downloads/3.5-extensions/). I watched his [How-To Screencast on the MVC Framework](http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/e/b/febedc0c-dd47-4062-ad53-40e34d556a5d/ScottHanselmanIntroToMVC.wmv) a couple of weeks ago and marvelled at the quality of the experience that Scott has created. Very professionally done, at least I think so. Your view counts too, though, and Scott has [requested feedback](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourOpinionMattersScreencastTechniquesSurvey.aspx) on his screencast style.
