[
10 months ago, I wrote](/2003/07/20/31fa922e2fca4fc0a26b0fb0e115448e) about the expected divergence between C#
and VB.NET. I think we're starting to see the beginning of
this:

<blockquote>[Paul
Vick](http://panopticoncentral.net/archive/2004/04/23/991.aspx): _Roy raises the question as to whether divergence
between the languages like this is a good thing or a bad thing.
While I'm sympathetic to his point about increased difficulties
moving between two languages, it does raise the question: what's
the point of having two separate languages if they have exactly the
same set of features? Case insensitivity vs. case sensitvity, for
example, is not reason enough alone for Microsoft to invest all the
money that it does building both products._</blockquote>

I have mixed feelings now about my view back then that this
would reduce the arguments between choosing C# or VB.NET. Maybe I
was too optimistic. However, I still think that the potential is
there to change the debate from a religious one into something more
sophisticated dealing with the features present or missing in
each.
