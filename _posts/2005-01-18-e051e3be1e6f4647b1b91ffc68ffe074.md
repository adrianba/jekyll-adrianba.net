If you can't get on with running as a non-admin user or a common
task you need to do requires you to be an administrator then take a
look at Michael Howard's article
[
Browsing the Web and Reading E-mail Safely as an Administrator](http://msdn.com/library/en-us/dncode/html/secure11152004.asp).
The article describes how to take advantage of the
[SAFER](http://msdn.com/library/en-us/secmgmt/security/safer.asp)
features built into Windows XP and Windows 2003 to at least go some
way to increasing your security.
