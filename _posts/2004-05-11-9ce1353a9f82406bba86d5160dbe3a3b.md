  * [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/) is a FREE version
of the SSH protocol suite of network connectivity tools that
increasing numbers of people on the Internet are coming to rely on.
Many users of telnet, rlogin, ftp, and other such programs might
not realize that their password is transmitted across the Internet
unencrypted, but it is. OpenSSH encrypts all traffic (including
passwords) to effectively eliminate eavesdropping, connection
hijacking, and other network-level attacks. Additionally, OpenSSH
provides a myriad of secure tunneling capabilities, as well as a
variety of authentication methods.
  * [OpenSSH for
Windows](http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net/) is a free package that installs a minimal OpenSSH
server and client utilities in the Cygwin package without needing
the full Cygwin installation.
  * [ProxyTunnel](http://proxytunnel.sourceforge.net/)
is a program that connects stdin and stdout to a server somewhere
on the network, through a standard HTTPS proxy. It is mostly used
to tunnel SSH sessions through HTTP(S) proxies.
  * [SSH
Proxy Command -- connect.c](http://www.imasy.or.jp/~gotoh/ssh/connect.html) is the simple relaying command to
make network connection via SOCKS and https proxy. It is mainly
intended to be used as proxy command of OpenSSH.
