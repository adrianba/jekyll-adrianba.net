I've written before about my expectations for the divergence of
VB.NET and C# given their different target audiences.
[
Paul Vick takes a view from a slightly different angle](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2004/10/18/1800.aspx) about
the benefits to Microsoft of having the different language
teams.

Now it could be argued that if there was only one true language
then the people from the different teams could still (and would
have to) innovate all into this common language. First, given their
disparate goals, this seems a little unlikely to work. Second,
while I have my own preferences for the language I use, I like that
our platform is broad enough to support people with different views
and backgrounds without forcing them to conform to any single
standard.
