I'd forgotten about the Microsoft ClearType support in Windows XP.
I'd used it briefly in the past when I was playing with Microsoft
Reader. If you're using an LCD (flat screen) display with Windows
XP, then you can enable and _calibrate_ the ClearType
support at
[
Activating ClearType](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/cleartypeactivate.htm?fname=%20&fsize=)Â (you can just enable it in the
Display control panel under Appearance, Effects).
