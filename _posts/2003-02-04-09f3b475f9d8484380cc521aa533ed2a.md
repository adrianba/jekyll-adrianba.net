.NET Application Updater Component](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/windowsforms/appupdater.aspx)

This article talks about an approach to building .NET client
applications that are able to automatically update themselves.

<blockquote>_This component is not a Microsoft product. It is intended as
a sample to get you started and as such the source is also included
with this whitepaper. However, it is worth mentioning that this
component has gotten a fair amount of real world use already. It
has been used internally in Microsoft to enable auto-updatability
in the .NET Terrarium game._
