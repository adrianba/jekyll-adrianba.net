[Daniel Cazzulino](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/) has
written a
[
comparison](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu/archive/2004/05/17/133196.aspx) between the
[
Enterprise Instrumentation Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/enterprise/eif/) (EIF) and
[log4net](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/).

I was anticipating using EIF on a recent project but it turned
out that log4net was so easy to implement and deploy that it was a
perfect fit for our requirements. The only thing I am slightly wary
about is that 1.2 of log4net seems to have been at beta8 for the
better part of a year and the move to the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF) doesn't seem to have achieved much.
