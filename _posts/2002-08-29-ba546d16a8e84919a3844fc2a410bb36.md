If you create a client proxy installation for a COM+
application, you can specify the remote server name (RSN) on the
command line to msiexec:

<blockquote>Msiexec /IÂ  myapp.msi RemoteServerName=XYZ
> 
> </blockquote>

This came from
[
Q246057 BUG: RSN Cannot Be Changed in COM+ for an Application
Proxy](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q246057) although the bug has nothing really to do with it.
