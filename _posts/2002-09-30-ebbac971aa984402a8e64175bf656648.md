ASP.NET Viewstate handling](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnaspnet/html/asp11222001.asp)

You can "tamper-proof" your viewstate to reduce the likelihood
of someone trying to spoof your application by setting the
**EnableViewStateMAC** attribute. If necessary you can
encrypt it too.

However, by default, ASP.NET creates a random validation key and
stores it in each server's Local Security Authority (LSA). In order
to validate a ViewState field created on another server, the
**validationKey** for both servers must be set to the same
value. If you secure ViewState by any of the means listed above for
an application running in a Web Farm configuration, you will need
to provide a single, shared validation key for all of the
servers.

The article
[
Q313091 HOW TO: Create Keys by Using Visual Basic .NET for Use in
Forms Authentication](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q313091)Â shows how to generate keys for use in
the **validationKey** and the
**decryptionKey** attributes of the <machineKey>
section in the **<system.web>** element in the
Machine.config and the Web.config files.
