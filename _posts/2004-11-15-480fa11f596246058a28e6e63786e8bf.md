So it turns out that the power adapter that has been on pretty
much 24x7 under my desk for the last couple of years is susceptible
to overheating and is the subject of a recall by Dell. Obviously,
it isn't plugged in any more although I would have thought that
period was a pretty good soak test. Perhaps it just brings it
closer to the point where it does overheat.

In any event, the recall affects Dell laptop adapters (also used
with some port replicators) with either "P/N 9364U", "P/N 7832D",
or "P/N 4983D" printed on the back.

If you have one of these adapters, you can check to see if the
one you have is affected at

(I have two, one was affected and one wasn't).
