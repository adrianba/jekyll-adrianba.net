[Clay
Shirky](http://www.corante.com/many/20030801.shtml#50187): _Process is an embedded reaction to prior stupidity.
When I was CTO of a web design firm, I noticed in staff meetings
that we only ever talked about process when we were avoiding
talking about people._ [via
[Sam
Ruby](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1578.html)]

Clay Shirky makes such a perceptive observation about how
process gets created that I'm surprised that I hadn't thought about
it in quite those terms before. While talking about the lack of
process in Wikis, he explains why we end up with "_layers of
gunk that keep [the] best employees from doing interesting work,
because they too have to sign The Form Designed to Keep You From
Doing The Stupid Thing That One Guy Did Three Years Ago_".
