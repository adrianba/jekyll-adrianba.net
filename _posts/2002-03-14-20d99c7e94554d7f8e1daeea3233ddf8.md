Came across a useful tool this morning for recovering CD-RW disks
that have somehow become "corrupted". My CD writing software had
crashed while writing to a CD-RW disk and that meant that it didn't
look like a CD-RW to software any more - the error I was getting
was "unrecognisable media" or similar. Anyway, after a Usenet
search, I came across a program called
[
SuperBlank](http://home.planetinternet.be/~ping3828/websitedata/superblank/superblank.html)Â that did the trick and erased the disk enough
so that I could do a full erase with Easy CD Creator. Problem
solved.
