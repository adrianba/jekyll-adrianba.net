[VSIP Developer Community
Center](http://www.vsipdev.com/):
_[Register](http://www.vsipdev.com/partnerregistration.aspx)
to become a Visual Studio Industry partner and get FREE access to
the VSIP SDK. As a VSIP you will have access to the technology,
private newsgroups and secured technical content to assist you in
seamlessly integrating your tools, components, and languages into
the Visual Studio .NET IDE._

Looks like we finally get free access to VSIP. Hopefully this
will spur the development of loads of useful _integrated_
VS.NET tools now.
