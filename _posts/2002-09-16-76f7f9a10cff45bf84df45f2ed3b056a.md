ALAN COOPER, KNOWN as the "Father of Visual Basic" and the author
of The Inmates are Running the Asylum](http://iwsun4.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/01/06/15/010615hncooper.xml):

<blockquote>My advice to Microsoft is to abandon the browser. The browser is
a red herring; it's a dead end. The idea of having batched
processing inside a very stupid program that's controlled remotely
is a software architecture that was invented about 25 years ago by
IBM, and was abandoned about 20 years ago because it's a bad
architecture. We've gone tremendously retrograde by bringing in Web
browsers.
