We finally found a solution to the PNG problem we were having when
printing from Internet Explorer. A company that I'm doing some work
for have a system that produces a PNG file containing bar codes,
which is sent via HTTP to Internet Explorer from where the user can
then print the image. While this worked fine on NT4, on Win2000 and
WinXP, we were getting fuzzy printing, and Microsoft PSS were
unhelpful. We finally found that the PNG files were being generated
with a bit depth of 32 and that IE presumably thought this meant it
might be a photo and it ought to do some processing on it to give a
good print result (printing from other apps such as Paint gave
perfect results and we tried different print drivers, etc. with
IE). By converting the PNG to a simple monochrome image, IE leaves
well alone and we get a correct result.
