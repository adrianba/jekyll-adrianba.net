I wrote my first class library in managed C++ today having focussed
most of my .NET efforts on C# over the last year. This was
necessary so that I could link in an unmanaged code library for
which I don't have access to the source. Seemed a bit clunky but
worked in the end. The biggest issue was switching back and forth
between C# for my unit tests and C++ for the library. If I type
Math::PI or Math.PI the wrong way around once more...
