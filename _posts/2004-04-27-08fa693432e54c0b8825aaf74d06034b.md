I've been struggling with a few connection problems trying to
sync my SmartPhone to Outlook in recent weeks but since I was
already running ActiveSync 3.7.1 there wasn't much to be done.

It appears that Microsoft make reasonably silent releases of
ActiveSync. I
[
downloaded](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/resources/downloads/pocketpc/activesync37.mspx) 3.7.1 again and ran the installer: it told me I
already had 3.7.1 installed but I could go ahead and reinstall it.
When I did and checked the about box I now have a much higher build
number and the connection seems much snappier now. Who knew? I
guess I'll be keeping a closer eye on it now.
