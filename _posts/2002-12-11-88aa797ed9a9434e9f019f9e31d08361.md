I've been using GDI+ to do some basic image processing to add
PNG output support to an application that previously only handled
writing BMP files. I selected the 24bpp RGB format because I didn't
need an alpha channel but the image files weren't being compressed.
The sample code in
[
MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdicpp/gdi+/usinggdi+/usingimageencodersanddecoders/determiningtheparameterssupportedbyanencoder/listingparametersandvaluesforallencoders.asp) shows that the PNG encoder doesn't have any parameters and
it seems compression is dependent upon the bit-depth. Once I
selected 32bpp ARGB (the default for the Bitmap class apparently),
the compression was enabled and my 150K test file went down to
1K.
