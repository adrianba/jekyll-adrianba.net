After reading
[Simon's
recommendation](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2003/08/1345.html) for
[POPFile](http://popfile.sourceforge.net/) a week or so
ago, I decided that I would give it a go after all. I'd looked at
it previously but decided not to bother installing in the end for
whatever reason. Instead of using it to proxy my calls to my POP3
mailboxes, I have installed
[Outclass](http://www.vargonsoft.com/Outclass/), which
is an add-in for Outlook that uses the POPFile engine but from
within Outlook itself.

So far, I'm impressed. It is filtering out spam with an amazing
accuracy - it's probably only mis-classified a 4 or 5 messages in
the last few days, and for a couple of those, it's debatable
whether they don't really count as spam anyway. I've disabled all
the Outlook rules that I had in place to try to capture spam - this
does a much better job.
