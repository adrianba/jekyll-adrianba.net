Suzanne Cook posts](http://weblogs.asp.net/suzcook/archive/2004/10/28/249280.aspx) about making an unmanaged DLL part of a
managed assembly so that it can be deployed and versioned in the
same fashion as other managed assemblies. This technique works well
for DLLs that you need to P/Invoke into using DllImport.
