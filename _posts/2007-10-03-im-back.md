You'd be forgiven for thinking that maybe I left for the PDC in September 2005 and never came back. The truth is work got on top of me and before I knew it, it had been months since I'd posted anything. I didn't want to be one of those lapsed Microsoft bloggers who pop up and say they're back and then never post again. I decided that I wasn't going to blog any more until I was confident that I'd keep it up. Hopefully that time is now and this won't be that solitary "I'm back" post I was so worried about.
