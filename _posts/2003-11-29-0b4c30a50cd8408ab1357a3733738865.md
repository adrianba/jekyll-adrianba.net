A few weeks ago, I
[
complained](/2003/08/31/b253bcc25508482c9e0392db3386050d) that VB.NET was missing features that programmers
using languages of the braces and semicolon ilk had had for
ages.

Paul Vick
[
announced](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/PermaLink.aspx/39e3baf9-c6ef-48b8-a359-b37e51208e79) a couple of weeks ago that code analysis for missing
return values and unreferenced or uninitialised variables will be
coming in Whidbey. This is good news.
