With little fanfare, it seems that
[
Windows Installer v3.0 shipped](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=5fbc5470-b259-4733-a914-a956122e08e8) in November. The
[
platform SDK page about Windows Installer](http://msdn.com/library/en-us/msi/setup/windows_installer_start_page.asp) notes that this
release includes more sophisticated patch handling and a few new
enterprise management features. This version also provides some
slightly less cryptic
[
command line options](http://msdn.com/library/en-us/msi/setup/standard_installer_command_line_options.asp).
