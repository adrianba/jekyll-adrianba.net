[Sam Ruby](http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/10/22/Post-Update-Restart): _Whenever I find myself updating a script I wrote months or even years ago, these days my first step is to do a git init._

 

Over the last few months, Ia€™ve seen quite a few people commenting about how [git](http://git.or.cz/) is a a€oebettera€ source control system than [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/). Today I watched [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8) as Linus Torvalds talked at Google about the ideas behind the creation of git. Ita€™s both entertaining and informative and I think now I understand what they meant.
