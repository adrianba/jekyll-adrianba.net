It's funny, isn't it, how when you're looking for something on
the web you invariably end up following a path you never intended
because something catches your attention. I've just seen a couple
of links to tiny storage devices:
[](http://www.thumbdrive.com/)[
http://www.thumbdrive.com/](http://www.thumbdrive.com/)Â and
[](http://www.diskonkey.com/)[
http://www.diskonkey.com/](http://www.diskonkey.com/). I haven't seen these before and as
soon as they make one a little bigger (they seem to go up to 512 MB
at the moment), then I will definitely want one. Being able to
back-up all my work and carry it on my key ring would be very
cool.
