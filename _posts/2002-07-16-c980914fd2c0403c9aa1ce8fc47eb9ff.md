[SQL
Server Trace Flags](http://radio.weblogs.com/0105852/2002/07/15.html#a698).
[Trace
flags are used](http://www.devasp.net/Net/Articles/Randy/TraceFlags.asp) to temporarily enable or disable specific
database functions allowing you to change default database behavior
or to observe hidden database behavior and will remain in effect
until they are either manually turned off or SQL Server is
restarted. Keep in mind that most trace flags are undocumented and
Microsoft can and will change the behavior of the flag between SQL
Server versions, service packs or hotfixes.

Very useful.
