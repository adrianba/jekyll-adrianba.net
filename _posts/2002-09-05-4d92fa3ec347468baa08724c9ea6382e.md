I keep forgetting to link to
[TopCoder.com](http://www.topcoder.com/). What a cool
idea, online programming competitions!
[[joelonsoftware](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/)]

Wow, this _is_ cool. Competitions can be entered
using Java, C++, and C#. The competition environment runs
using Java and there are practice rooms to try it out with.
