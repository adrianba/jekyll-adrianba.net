[
Detecting and Resolving Stalled and Stuck I/O Issues in SQL Server
2000 SP 4](http://msdn.microsoft.com/sql/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnsqldev/html/sqldev_04222005.asp) is an interesting article highlighting the changes in
[SP4](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/downloads/2000/sp4.asp)
that help to diagnose I/O issues. At Microsoft UK in Reading, we
have a scalability lab configured to allow customers to come for a
week and measure their application performance in an isolated
environment. The goal often includes helping to identify and solve
performance issues. I've seen a few customers start the week with
massively I/O bound databases and this will provide additional
information when we look at this. It will also be great for PSS to
help diagnose I/O issues remotely, which can be a time consuming
process. Beyond that, of course, it will help customers to identify
and solve these problems independently.
