[Ethereal](http://www.ethereal.com/) is a free network
protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows. It allows you to examine
data from a live network or from a capture file on disk. You can
interactively browse the capture data, viewing summary and detail
information for each packet. Ethereal has several powerful
features, including a rich display filter language and the ability
to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.
