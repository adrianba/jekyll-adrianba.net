Last week there was an issue with the FolderShare service, which may have inadvertently moved original files to the FolderShare Trash folder. This is detailed on the [FolderShare](https://www.foldershare.com/) site:

**-- Urgent FolderShare User Notification --**           
         
Dear FolderShare friends,           
         
This message is to alert you to a potential issue with the data you have saved with FolderShare.           
         
**Please do NOT delete files from your FolderShare Trash folder until you have verified that you were not affected by this situation.**           
         
From 12/3/07 to 12/6/07, some files may have been accidentally moved from their original folders into the FolderShare Trash folder. The bug that caused this problem has been fixed.           
         
The only files affected are ones with names containing certain characters, such as accents, trademark signs, etc. For example, â€œEspaÃ±a.jpg.â€           
         
If you were impacted, **your files should still be recoverable**. They can be found and restored from the FolderShare Trash._
