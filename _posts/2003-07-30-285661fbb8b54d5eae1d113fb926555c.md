<blockquote>_Two tools make up the IIS Debug toolkit and are
designed to help figure out what requests were in flight when IIS
terminates unexpectedly or take action when a request hangs. Use
this tool if you notice IIS terminating unexpectedly or if you want
to figure out why a request is hanging._
