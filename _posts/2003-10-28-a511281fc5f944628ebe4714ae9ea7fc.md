There are little odds and ends mentioned in the keynote seeping slowly into my head despite the jetlag really starting to kick in (what with the daylight saving change I'm out by 9 hours or something!). The breakout sessions are starting to put things into more perspective and in the next few days I think things will start to make more sense. Suffering from sensory overload for now!

**Update:** here is the [ transcript](http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2003/10-27PDC2003.asp) of Bill Gates' keynote.
