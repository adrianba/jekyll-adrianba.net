title: "Fix Surface Type Cover after firmware update"

This week there were Surface Pro 4 firmware updates as part of the Patch Tuesday updates. After
the system updates completed on my SP4, the type cover stopped working. The backlight didn't work
and the Surface didn't recognise the keyboard being removed or plugged back in.

After reaching out to people here at Microsoft, I learned that you can make some internal systems
within the Surface reset by holding down the power button and volume up button at the same time for
about 20 seconds. That reset got my keyboard working again.

I've seen a few forum posts where other people ran into this issue but no clear message about how
to fix it, so hopefully if you run into the issue then you'll find your way to this post with a
solution.
