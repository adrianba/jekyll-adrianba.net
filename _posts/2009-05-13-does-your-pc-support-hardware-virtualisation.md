The release of a [beta of Virtual PC for Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx) allows Windows XP applications to run in a way that integrates them into the usual Windows desktop without it being obvious that an entire second copy of Windows is running. Virtual PC on Windows 7 requires hardware virtualisation and I was looking for a quick way to determine whether that is supported on any given PC.

 

[SecurAble](http://www.grc.com/securable.htm) by Gibson Research Corp supports both Intel and AMD CPUs and tells you simply whether the processor is 64-bit capable, whether it supports [Data Execution Prevention](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/875352) technology, and whether it supports hardware-assisted virtualisation.
