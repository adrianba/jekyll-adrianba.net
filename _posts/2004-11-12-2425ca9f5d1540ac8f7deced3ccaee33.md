This](http://www.jtleigh.com/people/colin/blog/archives/2004/11/copysourceashtm_2.html) is definitely one of the easiest to use tools to turn
source code into syntax colored HTML. It's a Visual Studio plug-in.
The HTML it generates uses CSS, and is pretty lightweight (in fact,
it looks more or less exactly like I would write it, if I were
doing to make a tool like this)._
