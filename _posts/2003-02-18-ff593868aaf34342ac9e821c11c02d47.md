Haven't looked at
[
this](http://www.denisbauer.com/ASPNETControls/DynamicControlsPlaceholder.aspx) in any great detail but might be worth returning to:

Problem:  

ASP.NET gives a developer the opportunity to programmatically add
controls to a web form using ParentControl.Controls.Add(new
Control()); However, these controls are not persisted in any way
thus having to be recreated for each subsequent request.

Goal:  

To create a control that behaves like a placeholder but
additionally handles recreating dynamic controls on subsequent
requests.
