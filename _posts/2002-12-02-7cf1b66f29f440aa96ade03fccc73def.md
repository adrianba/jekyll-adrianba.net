I've been thinking about
[this](/2002/12/02.html)
further:

<blockquote>_Surely the argument about DataReaders isn't the cost of
opening the connection, it's the fact that the connection lives
much longer and hence reduces scalability?_

One could make the argument that in fact getting a connection,
getting you data, and getting off as quickly as possible, is much
more important than the efficiency of DataSet's or otherwise at the
middle tier. It's generally a lot easier to scale out the middle
tier than improve the scalability of the database.
