ASP.NET Process Model -
[
Thomas Marquardt [DOTNET-CLR]](http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=ind0209d&L=dotnet-clr&T=0&F=&S=&P=2193):

"While I doubt there is anything particular about high isolation
mode that would cause problems for ASP.NET, I would feel better if
you were to use low isolation. The recommended configuration is
<processModel enable="true"/> and low isolation mode selected
in IIS metabase."
