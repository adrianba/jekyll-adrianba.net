[Joel
on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html): _There's UCS-4, which stores each code point in
4 bytes, which has the nice property that every single code point
can be stored in the same number of bytes, but, golly, even the
Texans wouldn't be so bold as to waste that much memory._ [via
