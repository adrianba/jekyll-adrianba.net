Is this really "a perfect application of RSS"? I'm not sure -
the HTTP polling troubles me but in some ways it's little different
from POP3 polling for e-mail. I'm not saying this is right or wrong
and certainly not getting at Greg specifically. I've seen this type
of comment in other places dealing with other kinds of resources
such as Windows event logs. Is RSS the best approach?
