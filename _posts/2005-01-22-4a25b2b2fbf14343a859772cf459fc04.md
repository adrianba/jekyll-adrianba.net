A new version of the Log Parser tool (v2.2) has
[
just been published](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=890cd06b-abf8-4c25-91b2-f8d975cf8c07). Scott Hanselman posts about his
[
experiments parsing IIS log files](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,5df357af-aa7f-4edb-8a5f-f1500dea9aaf.aspx).

This version includes a bunch of new input/output formats
including tab separated text files. Not only is Log Parser a great
tool for querying common Windows logs, it can be really useful for
parsing audit or log files created by your own applications.
