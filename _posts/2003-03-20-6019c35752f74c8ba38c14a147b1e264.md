[RDF Primer
Primer](http://notabug.com/2002/rdfprimer/)_"The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a
system for storing and sharing data between computer programs. This
document will help you understand the important pieces of RDF
quickly and then walk you through writing your own RDF files, and
creating your own types of RDF information (often called RDF
vocabularies or schemas)."_

A good introduction to what RDF looks like although I had to
read the bit about _reification_Â  couple of times to
get it.
