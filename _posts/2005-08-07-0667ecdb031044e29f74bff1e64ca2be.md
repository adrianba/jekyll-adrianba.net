If you struggle with FxCop complaining about code that was
generated for you, say from WSDL or XSD, then help is (well, will
be) at hand. In .NET 2.0 (RTM), the tools generating this code will
introduce a [GeneratedCode] attribute that signals to FxCop that it
should relax its rules. Since you don't have any control over the
generated code, FxCop is really generally useful for the times when
you can do something to fix the warning you're being given. If you
write your own tools that generate code, you'll be able to emit
this attribute in the same way.
