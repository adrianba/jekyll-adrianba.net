I've been looking at the
[HTML Tidy Library
Project](http://tidy.sourceforge.net/) based
on [Dave
Raggett's](http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/) HTML Tidy program and I wanted a way to call into the
library from .NET. The two links to .NET bindings on the site point
to code that uses COM Interop which seemed a little odd.
Surprisingly, Charles Reitzel's
[Tidy Add-ons
page](http://users.rcn.com/creitzel/tidy.html) says "_Managed C++ is simply too different from real
C++ to be useful, imo. Or, as I like to say,__Managed
C++ is neither._" Now, that
[can't
be right](http://dotnetweblogs.com/sgentile/posts/5827.aspx)[
can it](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22C%2B%2B+rocks%22)? :o)

So this is my first cut at a
[
MC++ binding for HTML Tidy](/software/download/TidyNET.zip). I pulled down the source to
libtidy, converted the VC6 workspace to VC7 and built a release
library (that's included in the libtidylib folder of the zip
download). This zip file contains the source and a release binary.
I haven't included support for callbacks or for processing thr HTML
Node model because I don't need those right now.
