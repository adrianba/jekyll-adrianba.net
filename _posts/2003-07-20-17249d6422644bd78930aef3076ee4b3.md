development company. He talked about the artists that he employeed.
Developers, he said, saw problems as black and white - you either
solved the problem or you didn't. Artists, however, see problems as
red and blue. Neither is right or wrong, rather one is red and one
is blue. The key, he continued, is to never have a red/blue person
work for a black/white person._
