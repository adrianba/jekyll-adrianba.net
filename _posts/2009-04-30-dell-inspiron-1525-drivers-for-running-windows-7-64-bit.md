Ia€™ve been running builds of Win7 on my 1525 for some time after doing an in-place upgrade from Vista 32-bit to the Win7 Beta. We recently announced that [we wona€™t support build to build upgrades](http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/04/07/delivering-a-quality-upgrade-experience.aspx) from Win7 Beta to Win7 RC (which will be [available to MSDN/TechNet subscribers tomorrow](http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windows7/archive/2009/04/24/windows-7-release-candidate-update.aspx)) I could either revert to Vista and do another upgrade or install from scratch. I decided to take the opportunity to move to 64-bit and since thata€™s not possible when doing an upgrade from 32-bit Vista I installed from scratch. Although all the hardware was successfully detected, this left me without some of the Dell utilities including things like the Wi-Fi sniffer and full scrolling support from the Trackpad driver.

 

Therea€™s a useful post on the TechNet forums about [which drivers to use on a Dell Inspiron 1525](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/7e5d168b-c991-4b06-a2aa-ee8a29edac89/) if you want to upgrade from 32-bit Vista to 64-bit Vista or Win7 and this helped get me up and running. It turns out that some of the 64-bit drivers arena€™t listed for the 1525 but address the same hardware on other Dell machines and so work just fine.
