I like to have a couple of desktop clock gadgets so that I can see the time in different time zones without having to think about it. A while ago I found a gadget that I like but there are lots of clocks in the Windows Live Gallery and so Ia€™m never sure if Ia€™m picking the same one when I install on a new machine. Sure, I could copy the file locally and make sure I just install that each time but that pre-supposes that I have access to the copy when I need it. Instead, Ia€™m going to bookmark it here and then I know how to find my way back. Ita€™s the [Digital World Clock](http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=cb194986-22fc-43b5-97c2-21dd652fa51a) a€" thanks SARWAR.
