_Steve Shockley set me a pointer via my comments to the
[Windows
Compact Disk Management Script](http://berns.cae.wisc.edu/pages/wincdman.asp). Thanks, Steve! I wish I had
known about this BEFORE I downloaded 2GB of ISO images for Win2K,
WinXP and Win2K3 from MSDN. My MSDN universal subscription doesn't
ship the ISO images - just the CD layouts on DVD's. This utility
would have saved me a bunch of time; I hope this link helps out
somebody else._
