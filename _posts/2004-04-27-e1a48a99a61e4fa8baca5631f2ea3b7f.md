If you are using a hash to hide the value of a password then it
is a good idea to throw in a salt so that two people with the same
password will have different values stored. It also increases the
amount of work necessary to perform a dictionary attack on the
passwords.

In the
[
Security Briefs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/08/SecurityBriefs/) article in
[
MSDN Magazine August 2003](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/08/default.aspx),
[Keith Brown](http://www.develop.com/kbrown/) provides a
[
SaltedHash class](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/08/SecurityBriefs/figures.asp#fig2) that does the job nicely to save you few
minutes writing it yourself.

The only change I made was to substitute
SHA1CryptoServiceProvider with SHA1Managed to avoid leaving managed
code (SHA1CryptoServiceProvider is implemented using CAPI).
