[Joshua Allen](http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/) has
a
[
nice post](http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=f5ae0c57-16d6-4b5f-a178-412d26bd78f4) about data normalisation. He suggests that sometimes
it is necessary for performance and scalability reasons that you
don't fully normalise your data schema. This is something I've run
into occasionally too but, as I recall, isn't something that was
taught in the academic database design courses I attended way back
when.
