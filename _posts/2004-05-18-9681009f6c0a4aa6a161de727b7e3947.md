_[
Microsoft File Checksum Integrity Verifier](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=b3c93558-31b7-47e2-a663-7365c1686c08&displaylang=en) is a command line
utility that computes and verifies hashes of files._

_It computes a MD5 or SHA1 cryptographic hash of the content
of the file. If the file is modified, the hash is
different._

_With FCIV, you can compute hashes of all your sensitive
files. When you suspect that your system has been compromised, you
can run a verification to determine which files have been modified.
You can also schedule verifications regularily._
