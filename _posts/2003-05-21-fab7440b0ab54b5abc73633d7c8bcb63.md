From time to time I've considered making a call from a SQL
Server stored proc into a .NET assembly via COM Interop using the
sp_OA stored procedures as a mechanism to perform some database
triggered activity (say from a scheduled job). I've always found a
different solution in the end and it turns out to have been lucky
that I did so:

[Q322884 -
INF: Using Extended Stored Procedures or SP_OA Stored Procedures to
Load CLR in SQL Server Is Not Supported](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=322884)

To increase performance,Â the CLR internally uses
thread-local-storage (TLS) which isn't allowed inside the SQL
Server memory space. In addition, SQL may be configured to use
fibers, which the CLR additionally doesn't support.
