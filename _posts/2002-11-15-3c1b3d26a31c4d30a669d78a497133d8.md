[Andy McMullan's
.NET FAQ](http://www.andymcm.com/dotnetfaq.htm)

<blockquote>_"This FAQ tries to answer some commonly asked questions
about the fundamentals of the .NET Framework. By fundamentals I
mean the nuts and bolts of how the .NET Framework works at a low
level - topics like assemblies, garbage collection, security,
interop with COM, and remoting. The most commonly-used parts of the
class library are also covered. Other aspects of the .NET Framework
such as ASP.NET, ADO.NET and WinForms are not
covered."_
