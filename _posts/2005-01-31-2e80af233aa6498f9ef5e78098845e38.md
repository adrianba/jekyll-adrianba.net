Talking about the divergence between VB.NET and C# while
considering their typical audiences is a
[
common theme](/2004/11/08/04d08287c82c44f29e3cd38fd1da24dc). The
[
default instance](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2005/01/25/7392.aspx) support that provides singletons for common
types is another example of this. In and of itself, I don't have a
problem with this direction. This is a perfect example of making
the things that your customers want to do often much easier.

However, I worry about the effect of this on developers'
understanding of types. In the VB6 world, it was common to speak to
people who didn't understand the difference between a form type and
the form itself because of the default instance. This blurring then
made it difficult for them to apply their VB knowledge to producing
classes in an OO fashion. I have a feeling that VB.NET default
instances is going to cause the same problem again.
