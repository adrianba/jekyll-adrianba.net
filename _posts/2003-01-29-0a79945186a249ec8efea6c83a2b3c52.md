I've been working on fixing up my IE Printing helper which broke
when IE6 SP1 was released (I think). According to
[
Q220830](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q220830) (INFO: Syntax of the Res: Protocol and Some Known
Related Issues):

<blockquote>_You do not have to specify the whole path to the module, on
the condition that the module is either in the path or is a loaded
DLL._
> 
> _For example, you can shorten this longer path from
Res://c:projectsdebugTest.exe/Test.htm to the shorter path of
Res://Test.exe/Test.htm on the condition that Test.exe is in the
path, in the startup directory, or in the working
directory._

It seems like _res://myloaded.dll/page.htm_ now loads in
the Internet zone and hence I get security errors whereas
_res://c:pathtomy.dll/page.htm_ loads in the My Computer
zone and so is fine.

Has anyone else seen this? Is it documented anywhere? Is there a
legitimate security reason for why they would have done this?
