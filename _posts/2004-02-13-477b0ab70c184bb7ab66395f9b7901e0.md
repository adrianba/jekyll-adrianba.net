Robert Hurlbut](http://weblogs.asp.net/rhurlbut/archive/2004/02/12/71854.aspx) follows up Sam Gentile's
[post](http://samgentile.com/blog/archive/2004/02/12/11304.aspx)
about distributed development. There's not much I can argue with
here. In my response yesterday, I mentioned security as being one
situation in which I support physical separation of the public
presentation tier from the underlying business logic.

I am curious, however, about what a "well-defined pipe using
COM+/ES server components" looks like from a security perspective.
Doesn't this require DCOM, which, from memory, pretty much blew a
hole in any firewall?

Tiago Pascoal](http://weblogs.asp.net/tspascoal/archive/2004/02/13/72424.aspx) agrees with me about horizontally scaling
applications and shares the same experiences with respect to
database bottlenecks. He also calls for Sam and Robert to share
more insights about their architecture - this exchange of ideas and
experience is an excellent way to learn more about this
subject.
