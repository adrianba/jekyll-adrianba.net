With .NET 2.0, there is an SDK tool
[sgen](http://winfx.msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dv_fxtools/html/cc1d1f1c-fb26-4be9-885a-3fe84c81cec6.asp) that allows you to pregenerate the assemblies
produced by the XmlSerializer. When you instantiate an
XmlSerializer on a given type for the first time, the code
internally writes out a C# source file that contains the code to
save and load the appropriate XML. This gets compiled into a
temporary assembly and means that the first time you hit this code,
there is a delay while this accomplished.

This can be quite noticeable for web service clients hitting a
complex service or a number of different services, particularly if
the application is often started to perform a particular operation
and then closed afterwards. The serializer cost is paid each time
the application is run.

There is a [
hotfix](http://support.microsoft.com/?id=872800) available from Microsoft PSS that provides support for
pregenerated XmlSerializer assemblies for web service clients with
.NET 1.1 (SP1).
