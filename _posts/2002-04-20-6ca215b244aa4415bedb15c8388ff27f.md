I've uploaded a revised version of my Internet Explorer add-in
for "width-fitted" printing (must come up with a better term than
that). You can get it from the same
[
download page](/software/download/IEPrint.htm) as before.

This version includes a better print preview interface and fixes
a few rounding errors when scaling the page. Unfortunately, I've
not yet managed to fix a problem reported by Tim Tabor (thanks)
that appears to be related to fixed-width characters and results in
slight clipping on the right hand edge still. I can work around it
by making the browser window a little bigger, but it is
annoying.

There was also a problem reported where IE reported that a
script was taking too long to run but I haven't been able to
reproduce the error.

Finally, I have a couple more changes to make and then I'll make
the source code available.
