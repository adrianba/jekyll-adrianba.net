I seem to be bumping into SharePoint issues at the moment. Okay,
[
last week's](/2003/11/21/f8e1a46c82384f1c85475f0b5f35402a) wasn't SharePoint specifically and was down to
dcpromo, but only came to light installing WSS.

Now we have this one:

[833019 - You
Receive an Error Message When You Install Windows SharePoint
Services, Create a New Content Database, or Provision a New Virtual
Server](http://support.microsoft.com/?id=833019)

You get one of the following errors:

  * Metadata manifest 'C:Program FilesCommon FilesMicrosoft
SharedWeb Server Extensions60binsqmcfg.dll' does not exist or
has invalid signature. (Error code: 2779).
  * Metadata manifest 'C:Program FilesCommon FilesMicrosoft
SharedWeb Server Extensions60binsqmsto.dll' does not exist or
has invalid signature. (Error code: 2779).

The problem is mysteriously date related. The code checking the
validity of the DLL's is apparently broken and stops working after
November 24, 2003. The current work around is to set the date back
on the server, a less than comfortable experience. Hopefully there
will be a new release soon with a fix.
