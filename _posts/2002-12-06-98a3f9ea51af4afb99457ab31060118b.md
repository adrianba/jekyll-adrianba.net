[Visual
Basic Reference Counting vs. .NET Garbage Collection](http://www.clrmnd.com/ActivityLog/#11.29.2002).

<blockquote>_My first article. "I work with a few developers that are in
the process of migrating from Visual Basic 6 to .NET. The
transition for them is huge, but ultimately, there are a few issues
that rear their heads more than any others. One of these issues is
resource acquisition, initialization and
cleanup."[_[_ClrMnd -- Matt

and it tuns out that myself and others here have inspired him to
start his. Cool! Welcome. Rss-subscribed.

I listened to most of
[Chris Sells](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/) on
[.NET
Rocks](http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks.asp) this morning. It was mostly just interesting chat but the
one thing I did pick up that I hadn't considered before was the
idea of putting System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert(false) in the
finaliser for your IDisposable classes. This means that if you're
using a debug build and you forget to call Dispose, you'll
ultimately get an assertion failure to remind you when the GC
cleans up. I think this is helpful when moving to the GC
paradigm.
