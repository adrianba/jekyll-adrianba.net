[
Looking For the Best FTP Tool](http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/2003/12/23/FTPSuggestions.aspx):

<blockquote>_I am tired of holding my breath every time I have to FTP a
couple of files to a live site. I would like to find the hands down
best FTP tool out there. Free is nice, but not necessary._

I used to use [SmartFTP](http://www.smartftp.com/)
when I wanted a GUI interface, and
[NcFTP](http://www.ncftpd.com/ncftp/) the rest of the
time. Since I reinstalled everything on my laptop recently, I've
started using [
Internet Explorer](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=309816) as a GUI FTP client since I need this so
infrequently and it does a good job without having to install any
software. NcFTP is the client I use for scripting FTP; for example,
it is what downloads the log files from this site each day as part
of an automated task.
