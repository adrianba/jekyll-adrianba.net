Yesterday, a note was posted on the [IE blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/) about the ["hang recovery" feature in IE8 on Windows 7](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/05/04/ie8-in-windows-7-rc-reliability-and-telemetry.aspx). During testing, it was found that the timer used to determine if a tab in IE is not being responsive was found to be a little too sensitive on some people's computers, especially while using the built-in developer tools.

Today, two updates for IE8 on Win7 RC are available through Windows Update. The [first](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/960321) is the expected "[compatibility list](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/03/30/compatibility-view-list-and-ie8-rtw.aspx)". Since IE8 (and Windows 7) ship with an empty compatibility list, one needs to be downloaded after first install. The [second](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=970858) update is one to mitigate the issue of seeing the "webpage is not responding" dialog too frequently. The updates are both rated "Important" and it's recommended that you install both updates.
