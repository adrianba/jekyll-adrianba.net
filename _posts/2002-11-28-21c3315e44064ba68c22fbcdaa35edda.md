Apparently there is a bug in TLBIMP which means that, under
certain circumstances, the interop DLL that it generates won't
support events properly. This is probably a well-known issue that
everyone except me knows about, but I didn't find too much about it
on Google.

For example, capturing events from Windows Messenger doesn't
work by default and
[you need
to take the following steps](http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/msgaddin.asp):

  1. Use _Tlbimp.exe_ to generate a Messenger interop assembly
(this is located in _C:Program FilesMessenger_ by
default):
    
    
    tlbimp msmgs.exe /out:Messenger.dll
    

  2. Disassemble the interop assembly, and then save it as an IL
file: 

    
    
    ildasm /text Messenger.dll /out:Messenger.il
    

  3. Open the IL file in any text editor, and then change the
following line (mark the class as public instead of private): 

    
    
    .class private auto ansi sealed DMsgrObjectEvents_SinkHelper
    


to 

    
    
    .class public auto ansi sealed DMsgrObjectEvents_SinkHelper
    


and just below that 

    
    
    .class private auto ansi sealed DMsgrObjectEvents_EventProvider
    


to 

    
    
    .class public auto ansi sealed DMsgrObjectEvents_EventProvider
    

  4. Compile the IL file: 

    
    
    ilasm /dll Messenger.il
    

  5. This DLL is now ready to be referenced in a
project.
