[Internet
Explorer Fitted-Width Printing](/software/)

I've updated the
[
download](/software/download/IEPrint.htm) for the IE printing add-in to hopefully cure the
problem where it came up with security errors with IE6 SP1.

I will update the source code to match soon. Your _Downloaded
Program Files_ should list IEPrint with version 1.0.0.140 after
installing this version (the previous version was
1.0.0.123).

I'd be grateful to hear about any successes or failures with
this new version.
