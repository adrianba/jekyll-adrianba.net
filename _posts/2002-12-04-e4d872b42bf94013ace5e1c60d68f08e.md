Automatic Managed SQL Server Transactions

I've uploaded a
[
setup package for my SqlTx code](/software/download/VTSqlTx.msi). This includes the source code,
[NDoc](http://ndoc.sf.net/) documentation, and binaries
including an [NUnit](http://nunit.org/) test
harness.

To build the source you will need the following:

  * VS.NET to build the solution
  * NDoc (I am using version 1.1c) - the solution references NDoc
in "C:Program FilesNDoc" so you'll need to make some adjustments
if you have it elsewhere
  * NUnit 2.0 if you want to build and run the unit tests - again
this is referenced in "C:Program FilesNUnit V2.0"
  * You will need to create a key file VTSql.snk in the src folder
(I didn't include mine)
  * To run the unit tests you will need a database configured with
the two scripts in the database project and, if the connection
string is different, you will need to update it in the
ConnectionString class file

I will post my draft documentation later today once I've made a
few more changes.
