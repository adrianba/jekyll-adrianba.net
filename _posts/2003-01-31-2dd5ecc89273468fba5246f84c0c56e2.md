<blockquote>_What do you guys think? There is still time to address this
for NewsGator v1. I'm leaning toward defaulting to no referrer, and
allowing the user to override this with a custom referrer string.
Another option is what Aggie does (or used to), where the referrer
could be something like
http://www.newsgator.com/referrers?usersite=www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/.

If you were being strict about things, you'd probably say that
the referrer should be blank and just use the User Agent. I think
people are pretty used to looking at their logs by referrer and so
it wouldn't be a great stretch to also include a custom string for
this so that the information is all logged in one place. I think it
should be one of those two alternatives, though: blank or custom. A
static value linking to the user agent doesn't add much value.
