<blockquote>[
Hitting Code Complete](http://dotnetweblogs.com/ScottGu/archive/02162003.aspx#2493). _A tester -- sitting in their office
-- can configure the operating system and hardware they want to use
(for example: Windows Server 2000, Advanced Server Edition on a
2 processor hardware configuration with a German language
build) as well as the test suite they want to run (for example: all
session state tests).  The automation framework with then find
a hardware machine that meets the specification selected, reformat
and re-image the operating system for the choice selected, and then
execute the test suite run.  All pass/fail results can then be
viewed by the tester on their own machine with their office (fairly
fancy -- we are quire proud of this testing framework)._
