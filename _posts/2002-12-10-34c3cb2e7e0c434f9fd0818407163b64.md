Another annoying VS.NET "feature" is that when I've got a C++
project open, the solution explorer lists the files with a case
sensitive sort. This means that the source files that happen to
have been added with a lower case first character (by some previous
incarnation of MSVC++) are right at the bottom and it takes me a
while to remember to look down there. Especially bad when there are
a few hundred files all told.

I like VS.NET but things like this make me wish I'd paid more
attention during the beta process and reported a few more issues.
Unfortunately, I don't have the bandwidth (or the few days it would
take) to download the VS.NET 2003 beta to see if that is better. It
took the better part of a day to download the .NET 1.1 SDK and
runtime :o(.
