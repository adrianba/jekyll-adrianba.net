[sitecopy](http://www.lyra.org/sitecopy/cygwin/) is a
program for maintaining and synchronizing local and remote copies
of web sites. The program will upload files to the server which
have changed locally, and delete files from the server which have
been removed locally, to keep the remote site synchronized with the
local site with a single command.
