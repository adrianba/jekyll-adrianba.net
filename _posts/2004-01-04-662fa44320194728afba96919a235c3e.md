a custom channel sink](http://staff.develop.com/richardb/weblog/permalink.aspx/827189d3-ee0e-444f-b01d-bf9ce9f70f5c) to solve the problem where you get
strange remoting error messages from a SerializationException about
formatter version mismatches:

<blockquote>An unhandled exception of type
'System.Runtime.Serialization. SerializationException' occurred in
mscorlib.dll  
  

Additional information: BinaryFormatter Version incompatibility.
Expected Version 1.0. Received Version
1008738336.1684104552.</blockquote>

I have to admit to being pretty mystified when I first came
across this a few months ago having managed to steer clear of .NET
remoting for the most part. This bit of code looks like a real boon
for those moments when you run into this issue, which happen
periodically as you maintain and update your remoting code.
