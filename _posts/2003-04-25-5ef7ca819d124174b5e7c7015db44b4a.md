[How to run
ASP.NET 1.0 and 1.1 on the same box](http://www.asp.net/faq/SideBySide.aspx).

<blockquote>Old news I'm sure, but here's a
[great FAQ](http://www.asp.net/faq/SideBySide.aspx) on
how to simultaneously run ASP.NET 1.0 and 1.1 on the same box
(using Windows .NET Framework 1.0 and Windows .NET Framework 1.1 on
various IIS "Applications"). Useful stuff, and very easy.

Unfortunately, when you install .NET 1.1 through Windows Update,
it doesn't give you the option to not have it upgrade your ASP.NET
applications (I realise by reading this after having done the
update!).
