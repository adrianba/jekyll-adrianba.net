I bought [Don Syme](http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/)'s [Expert F#](http://www.apress.com/book/view/1590598504) book a couple of weeks ago. This is the definitive guide to a language that's going to become an officially supported part of the Visual Studio family in the coming year or so. [Amazon UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Expert-F-Experts-Voice-Net/dp/1590598504/) don't seem to have it yet so I bought from [Computer Manuals](http://www.compman.co.uk/scripts/browse.asp?ref=830554) and received a very speedy service.

 

I've seen quite a few rave reviews of [Advanced Windows Debugging](http://advancedwindowsdebugging.com/) including from [Raymond Chen](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/18/6794821.aspx) and also from [Mike](http://mtaulty.com/CommunityServer/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/archive/2007/12/21/10045.aspx). I think this one will make my wish list. :)
