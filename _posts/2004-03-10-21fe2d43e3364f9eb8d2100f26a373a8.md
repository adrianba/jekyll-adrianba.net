In a
[
well reasoned follow-up post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e73efd87-2cae-49af-9674-7076a054f2ca), Scott Hanselman explains why
storing ViewState in an ASP.NET Session isn't as easy as it first
appears. Amongst other good stuff, he makes two points I want to
reiterate:

  * _Spend less time writing wrongheaded plumbing code to
replace ViewState, and instead learn how to use it effectively and
efficiently._
  * _Buy Fritz's
[book](http://www.develop.com/books/essentialasp.net/)._
(This is such a well written and easy to read book - I say it is a
must have.)
