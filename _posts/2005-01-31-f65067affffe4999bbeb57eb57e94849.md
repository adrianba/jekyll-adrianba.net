As many have noted,
[
BizTalk 2004 SP1](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=f4a5ab9e-d599-4cc8-abdf-ae6ae68bac3d) was recently released. Possibly less well
known is the fact that at the same time, the BizTalk team have
moved to a "staged delivery model" for releasing product
documentation. Updated documentation is available for
[
download](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=cdd47461-f4e2-4bc6-b5c2-2018aff2823d&displaylang=en), as is an
[
updated installation guide](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=32ff7d19-9e25-44ce-8a8c-03e3eb5d726f&displaylang=en).
