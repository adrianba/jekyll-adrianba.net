<blockquote>_[Duncan](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma) points out a
[little
something extra](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/posts/10518.aspx) that VB.NET's Try...Catch syntax supports. It's
something the underlying IL supports and it seems useful, so we
figured, why not? A use that comes to mind is when dealing with
COMExceptions:_
>     
>     
>     Try<br></br>    ' Do some COM interop<br></br>Catch ex As COMException When ex.ErrorCode = &H80043919<br></br>    ' Handle this specific error<br></br>End Try
>     
> 
> _Nothing fancy, just a little something extra. An interesting
thing to note is that the CLR doesn't actually support specifying
both a type filter (i.e. ex As COMException) and a filter
expression (i.e. Where ex.ErrorCode = &H800043919), so the
above Catch clause is a filter expression that checks both the type
and the value together. It doesn't use a type filter. I was never
really clear why the CLR did it that way, but it's not a big deal
either way._
