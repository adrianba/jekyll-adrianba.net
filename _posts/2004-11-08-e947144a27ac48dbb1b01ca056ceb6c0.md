Mike Taulty has a good selection of
[book
recommendations](http://mtaulty.com/blog/archive/2004/10/21/808.aspx) for a .NET developer to have by their side.

I've recommended a good many of these myself and from the list
Essential ASP.NET and Essential XML Quick Reference would be top of
my shopping list.
