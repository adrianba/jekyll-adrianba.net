I've ordered a couple of components for my
[
Dell](http://www.euro.dell.com/countries/uk/enu/gen/default.htm) laptop from
[Dimension
Technology](http://www.dimensiontechnology.co.uk/). They may not have a fancy web site but their prices
look quite reasonable, they ship next day, oh and they were
recommended to me. Should get my bits tomorrow all being well. I
want to upgrade my hard drive so that I have more room for
[VMware](http://www.vmware.com/) virtual disks.
