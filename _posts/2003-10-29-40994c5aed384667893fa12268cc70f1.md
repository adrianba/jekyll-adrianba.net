[Drew](http://weblogs.asp.net/dmarsh/) has
[great
notes](http://weblogs.asp.net/dmarsh/posts/34308.aspx) on yesterday's Indigo Serialization talk by
[Doug Purdy](http://www.douglasp.com/). Doug has a
really unique presentation style and I swear he had his microphone
turned right down so that he could scream and shout at us.

As I've mentioned
[
before](/2003/08/31/c5af363240f045a7a3f82b43af7d1a52), XML Serialization is one of my favourite .NET features
and there are great new things to come, including much richer
support than we've had to date.

I won't go into huge detail because Drew and
[
Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e4e8f0af-35d6-4575-aacd-c1e129efda81) have that well covered, but I think the new
DataContract with versioning support looks really cool.
