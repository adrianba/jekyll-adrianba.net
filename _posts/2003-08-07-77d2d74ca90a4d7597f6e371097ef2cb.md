Alan Flaherty](http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=ind0308a&L=dotnet-web&T=0&F=&S=&P=7336): _Try
[iTextSharp](http://itextsharp.sourceforge.net), I've
been using it for creating rtf documents and it's a really nice
piece of work, (and its free :)). It's a c# implementation of the
iText JAVA-PDF library._
