Excellent
[
short MSDN TV segment](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20050317ASPNETSS/manifest.xml) explaining the Code Access Security (CAS)
features in ASP.NET 1.1. This allows you to lock down the
permissions for different ASP.NET applications using configured
trust levels and is especially appropriate for shared server
configurations.
