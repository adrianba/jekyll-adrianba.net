Okay, VB.NET has a more concise syntax for
[
checking reference equality](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/PermaLink.aspx/086feb98-d3d3-4831-a1ba-e8f70c72dac1) without calling out to
Object.ReferenceEquals:

<blockquote>"`If c1 Is c2 Then...`" vs. "`if
((object)c1 == (object)c2) {...}`"</blockquote>

Okay, VB.NET gets this one; I'm not yet persuaded however and my
preference is still for C# given the choice.
