Dare Obasanjo posts](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d98a420e-6679-474c-865a-30578338ceb8) about a change in .NET 1.1 SP1 that can
result in errors in RSS Bandit.

SP1 introduces new stricter parsing for the headers stored in a
WebHeaderCollection. This was added as a security precaution and is
of particular importance on servers. For example,
[Sanctum](http://www.sanctuminc.com/) recently published
a paper describing potential attacks on sites by sending badly
formed headers in web requests. The new parser imposes a strict
interpretation of [RFC
2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt).

As in Dare's case, it may be necessary to disable this new
behaviour if you communicate with servers that do return invalid
headers such as including spaces in header names. You do this by
adding a new setting to the application .config file:
    
    
    <system.net>
    <settings>
    <httpWebRequest useUnsafeHeaderParsing="true" />
    </settings>
    </system.net>
