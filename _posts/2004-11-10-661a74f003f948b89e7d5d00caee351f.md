[
MSN Music being available in the UK](http://www.dotnetconsult.co.uk/weblog/permalink.aspx/fc437c3d-92e2-4ce0-a981-0f3886d1542c). I've been using the UK
service for the last few weeks and I'm reasonably impressed. There
seem to be a few gremlins left to work out but overall the service
is good.

I'm particularly enamoured with the micropayment system for
streaming music. You can listen to a track streamed online for just
a penny. Since I listen to a lot of music through my PC and it's
unlikely that I'll want to listen to the same thing seventy-odd
times, it doesn't make sense to pay to download tracks so I just
listen online. I've played loads of stuff I haven't heard for ages
and also found a few CD's that I will probably buy now for the car
(I still like to have something tangible for my money) that I'd
never otherwise have tried.
