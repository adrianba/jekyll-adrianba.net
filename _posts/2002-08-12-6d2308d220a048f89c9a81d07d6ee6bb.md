[Jenifer
Tidwell: UI Patterns and Techniques](http://time-tripper.com/uipatterns/index.html). "Each of these patterns
(which are more general) and techniques (more specific) are
intended to help you solve design problems. They're common
problems, and there's no point in reinventing the wheel every time
you need, say, a sortable table -- plenty of folks have already
done it, and learned how to do it well. Some of that knowledge is
written up here, in an easily-digestible format."
