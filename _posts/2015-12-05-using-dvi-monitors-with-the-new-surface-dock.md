The new [Surface Dock](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/accessories/surface-dock) from Microsoft has two [mini-DisplayPort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_DisplayPort) outputs that can be used to connect a Surface Book, Surface Pro 3, or Surface Pro 4 to two external monitors.

 

This makes it possible to connect to VGA, DVI, or HDMI devices with the use of an adapter. However, to work with a DVI input you must use an active DVI adapter. Using a passive DVI cable will not work.

This results in the monitor displaying an error message: "_The current input timing is not supported by the monitor display. Please change your input timing to 1600x900@60Hz or any other monitor listed timing as per the monitor specifications._"

 

I found the [gofanco Gold Plated Mini Displayport to DVI Active Converter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OQX9526/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00OQX9526&linkCode=as2&tag=sailaboaacata-20&linkId=4NOERCYLKA3JVYE6) on Amazon works well with the Surface Dock and I am now driving my two monitors with a good stable image.![](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=sailaboaacata-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00OQX9526)
