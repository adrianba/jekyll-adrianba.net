I finally got around to publishing my
[Outlook
XP (2002) attachment unblocker applet](/software/ol2k2sec.html) that does the registry
tweaking mentioned in Q290497. No fancy set-up program I'm afraid -
it's only a tiny .EXE file so I just dropped it on as a .ZIP file.
If you don't know how to get things out of .ZIP files, then I guess
it may be dangerous to unblock the attachments in the first
place(!).
