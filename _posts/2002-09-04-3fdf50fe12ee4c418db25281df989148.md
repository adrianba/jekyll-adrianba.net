[Stunnel -- Universal SSL
Wrapper](http://www.stunnel.org/)

Stunnel is a program that allows you to encrypt arbitrary TCP
connections inside SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) available on both
Unix and Windows. Stunnel can allow you to secure non-SSL aware
daemons and protocols (like POP, IMAP, LDAP, etc) by having Stunnel
provide the encryption, requiring no changes to the daemon's
code.
