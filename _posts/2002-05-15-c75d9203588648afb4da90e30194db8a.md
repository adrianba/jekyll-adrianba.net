I received my copies of Refactoring and Design Patterns from Amazon
at the end of last week. Just need to find the time to read them
now - after I've finished reading Kent Beck's Extreme Programming
Explained that I'm about two thirds of the way through (and the
pile of reading material building up on my desk).
