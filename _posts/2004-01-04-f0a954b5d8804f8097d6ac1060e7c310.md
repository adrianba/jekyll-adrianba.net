_[The
HTMLEditor control](http://www.itwriting.com/htmleditor/index.php) is a wrapper for MSHTML, the rendering
portion of Internet Explorer (and IE's largest single component).
It is written in C#. Unlike the .Net webbrowser control, this is
not an ActiveX control. Rather it is an ActiveX Document. Even if
you are not interestd in MSHTML, you may be interested in the
HTMLEditor as an example of advanced .NET / COM interop. It's also
not suitable for embedded web browsing - use the ActiveX for
that._ [via
