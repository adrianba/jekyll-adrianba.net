If you're interested in writing apps that use the
[MSN Messenger](http://messenger.microsoft.com/)
protocol, [Chris
Sells](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/)Â has written some
[simple
C# code](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/tools/index.htm#imcli) to send messages.

Also, take a look at
[MSN Messenger
Protocol(Practical Implementation) a.k.a How to make your own MSN
Messenger In VB](http://www.venkydude.com/articles/msn.htm).

I've started my own asynchronous event-driven code library in C#
which is progressing well, but not quite ready for publishing yet.
Check again soon...
