Apparently, the [IE team sent a celebration cake to Mozilla](http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/06/sweet-plugin-microsoft-cake-20-for-firefox-3/) to congratulate them on shipping Firefox 3. It's ironic that the mozillalinks.org page describing this with photos doesn't exactly display correctly in IE7. However, if you use IE8's new standards rendering mode then you do get the page as you expect.

 

While it will be necessary for many sites to ["get ready" for IE8](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/06/10/introducing-ie-emulateie7.aspx) to ensure that their content continues to be displayed correctly, some sites written to rely on CSS 2.1 standards will suddenly leap into life.
