I finished reading the
[rejected
example](http://www.refactoring.com/rejectedExample.pdf) from the
[Refactoring](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485672)
book yesterday. Great stuff. In fact, so good that if this didn't
even make it into the book then it's now definitely on my Amazon
wishlist.
