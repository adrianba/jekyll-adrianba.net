[Scott
Watermasysk](http://scottwater.com/blog/posts/9514.aspx): _In
[part 1](http://www.artima.com/intv/csdes.html) of the
interview, Anders mentions an internal wiki that is used for the
design process. I would love to read that some day._

Reading this sparked off some more thoughts this week about the
use of a Wiki for documenting a design/development project. I
played around with [OpenWiki](http://openwiki.com/) a
few weeks ago, which is implemented using ASP and is a piece of
cake to get up and running.

The pages upon pages of notes I have written down for the
projects I'm currently working with can become difficult to manage
and there are a list of tasks in amongst them that are not only
waiting for me to complete, but also waiting for information from
other people. These tend to be little things that don't need to
show up on the overall project plan. Using a Wiki might be a way of
allowing other people to see the notes I'm taking and also see what
tasks are outstanding. If everyone did that then there would be a
much better sharing of information. However, the
[Wiki
Backlash](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1543.html) debate made me wonder if all that would be
manageable.

I've also experimented with
[Microsoft
OneNote](http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/onenote/) this week. Having originally written it off as
something that I really needed a Tablet PC for (and much as I'd
like one, the price/performance factor doesn't seem to make them
worth it yet), a few comments I've read recently suggested that it
was still a fantastic tool for keeping your notes even if you just
type into it. My evaluation suggested just that and if it wasn't
for the fact that the beta kept crashing on me, I might dispense
with a paper notebook, something that was previously an anathema
for me.

The outcome of this is that I think in the very near future,
I'll be managing much more of the day-to-day information that I
write down in an electronic (and hence searchable and sharable)
medium. How, exactly, I'm not yet sure: possibly a mixture of Wiki
and OneNote from the looks of things...
