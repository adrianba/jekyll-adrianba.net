As
[
Scott Guthrie reports](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/04/16/401381.aspx), Beta 2 for .NET 2.0 and Visual Studio
2005 was signed off at the end of last week and will be available
for download from [MSDN
Subscriber Downloads](http://msdn.com/subscriptions/) soon.

This is a milestone long awaited by many and comes complete with
the "Go-Live" license enabling production applications to use the
beta code. Congratulations to all the teams involved in shipping
this as they move on to the final chapter and shipping the RTM
version.
