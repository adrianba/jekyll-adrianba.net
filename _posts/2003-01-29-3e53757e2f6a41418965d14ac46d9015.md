I have been too busy to blog or even keep up to date with my RSS
subscriptions for the last few weeks so I am trying to catch up
today. Even though many posts will have disappeared off the bottom
of the RSS files, it's still too much to read so I'll have to skip
most of it.

[Greg
Reinacker's](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/default.aspx)[NewsGator](http://www.rassoc.com/newsgator/) seems to
have come on in leaps and bounds during those couple of weeks and
now demands a closer look whilst simultaneously putting an end to
my wish to write something similar (which is good because I don't
have the time anyway!).
