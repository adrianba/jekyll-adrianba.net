Managed C++ takes some time getting used to with its
___everything_ modifiers. C++/CLI is the new managed C++
what will ship with .NET 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005. For some
reason it reminds me of Pascal with its ^ tracking handles.
[Stan
Lippman has written a guide](http://msdn.com/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/transguide.asp) to the differences between the two
and how to migrate to C++/CLI.
