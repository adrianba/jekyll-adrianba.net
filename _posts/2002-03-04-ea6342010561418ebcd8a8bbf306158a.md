This site is largely done now, and converted to use "Radio
Userland". In the past, I'd used ASP but mostly to be able to use
some scripting and include files that made site maintenance easier.
This meant that each request for a givenÂ ASP file was actually
generating the same HTML response every time and Radio does all
that formatting in advance without losing any flexibility so I can
just server HTML files. In fact, I can even do updates without
having to worry about the upload process.

So, I'm just going to give it a couple of weeks before I shell
out my $40 for a Radio license to make sure I make full use of the
program. Looking good so far though.
