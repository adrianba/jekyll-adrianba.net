that selecting the compression ratio for ZIP files is a different
thing, for a few reasons: 1. It's mostly heritage, from when we had
slow CPUs and small hard disks. 2. A ZIP is an archive of multiple
files, not compression of a single file. 3. Selecting different
options actually used different compression systems, which yielded
different results._

1. I agree with this, but presumably GDI+ will be available on
portable devices with less CPU since it forms the basis for
System.Drawing.

2. Well, gzip works on one file and offers the same facility.
IIRC, PNG uses the same algorithm as gzip.

3. I'm not sure about this - I think the different options
affect the size of the lookahead buffer for the deflate algorithm
where a bigger bufferÂ may give better compression but will
require more processing.

Interesting discussion for a cold Thursday morning. :o)
Brrrr...just started trying to snow too.
