Q191168: INFO: Error "-2147168246 (8004d00a)" Failed to Enlist on
Calling Object's Transaction](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q191168&)

Solving "Failed to Enlist on calling object's transaction" or
"New transaction cannot enlist in the specified transaction
coordinator" issues. Note: cooperating DTC's must be able to see
each other with NetBIOS and be able to speak RPC to each other
which means lose that firewall.
