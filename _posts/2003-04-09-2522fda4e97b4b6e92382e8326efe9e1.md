_Speaking of ASP.NET, I hit chapter 4 (the HTTP Pipeline)
in_[_
Fritz Onion's book_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201760401)_, and let me tell you, this book is
a keeper. It's not the book I'd recommend for newbies, as it's
going to be over some people's heads, but it does cover some of the
more advanced topics in good detail. If you're doing any serious
ASP.NET development, I'd highly recommend this book, and I'm not
even finished with it yet!_

I absolutely second that. I finished the last chapter yesterday
and I'd have bought it just for the HTTP Pipeline chapter. It's
difficult to say whether I learned a tremendous amount of new
content from this book. Certainly, I knew a fair
amount about the different areas it covered, but I feel like a
have a more solid grounding and fundamental understanding of how
different features are implemented and why they work the way they
do. Another "must buy" book.

In fact, the only issue I have with the whole book is that it
seems like none of the example code includes any using statements
to import namespaces. This means I'm often left wondering
which namespace to include to pull in a particular class or
interface.
