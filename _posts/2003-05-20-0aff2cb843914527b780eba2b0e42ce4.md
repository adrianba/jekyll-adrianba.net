Craig points to a cool Microsoft tool](http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/permalink.aspx/146469a5-10be-4e45-bbe3-031de0fefb70) called
[
Windows Application Verifier](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/appexperience/appverifier.asp), which will watch a malfunctioning
app and tell you what it's doing wrong. Perfect for the developer
or QA person running as non-admin, especially if you're debugging
your own misbehaving app.
