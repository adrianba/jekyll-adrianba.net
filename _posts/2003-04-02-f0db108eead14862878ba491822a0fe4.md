When you get an MSDN subscription refresh that says _"All DVDs
in this shipment are red. You may archive all previous red
DVDs."_ but all the DVDs in the box are green, do you a)
archive all the red DVDs; b) archive all the green DVDs; or c) seek
advice from the nearest optician about the incidence of sudden
colour blindness?
