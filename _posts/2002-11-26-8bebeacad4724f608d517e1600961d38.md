[Good
Books](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021119.html) [[Joel on
Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/)]:

<blockquote>_A few months ago I read The Goal, by Eliyahu M. Goldratt,
mainly because it has become extremely popular at business schools,
and it looked fun. It was interesting, and fun. I didn't understand
how the book's theory, called the Theory of Constraints, could
possibly be applied to software development, but it was still
interesting enough, and I figured if I ever found myself running a
factory again, it would be helpful._
> 
> _Last week I discovered his newer book, Critical Chain. This
book applies the Theory of Constraints, introduced in The Goal, to
project management, and it seems to really make
sense._

I first read The Goal more than 10 years ago when it was
recommended to me as a must read by my boss at the time. I was
working in the design department of a factory and it seemed to
have much more relevance to me then than now. I read it again a few
months ago and was astonished at how much more I got out of it. I
think a lot went over my head all those years ago. I also read
the sequel, It's Not Luck where Goldratt expands upon his theory
and applies it more to everyday life. It's the kind of book you
read over and over squeezing out a little more understanding each
time. Heartily recommended. I think I'll have to get hold of
Critical Chain - this sounds good too.
