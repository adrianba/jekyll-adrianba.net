I fondly remember the release of Windows 2000 and what it
allowed us to do. With the introduction of COM+ and IIS 5, it
dramatically improved the lot for web development on Windows.

On June 30th 2005, Windows 2000 moved from Mainstream to
Extended Support. There is an area of microsoft.com that describes
the
[available
support options for Windows 2000](http://support.microsoft.com/windows2000support).
