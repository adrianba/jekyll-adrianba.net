The managed C++ compiler seems to have some issues, at least as far
as my installation is concerned. I have an interface written in C#,
which I'm implementing on one of my managed C++ classes. I updated
one of the interface methods to include an extra parameter and did
the same to the implementation. When I compiled, I got an error
stating that the method was not in the interface A::B::MyInterface
but was actually in A::B::MyInterface. Huh? I tried everything to
get it to build - full rebuilds of everything, rebooting, etc. In
the end, I took the new parameter out, rebuilt, put it in but in a
different place in the argument list, and rebuilt (successfully),
and then moved it back where it was originally. Guess what? It
worked then!
