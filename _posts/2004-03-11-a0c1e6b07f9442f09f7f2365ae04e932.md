I've been interested in
[Instant
Messaging and Presence](http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/impp-charter.html) for some time now. A number of protocol
groups were spawned from the IMPP effort including
[XMPP](http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/xmpp-charter.html),
an XML based protocol that is the core for the
[Jabber](http://www.jabber.org/) project.

Now, separately, an array of
[
specifications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx) have been written for web services, which are
fundamentally about exchanging messages with support for security,
reliability, addressing, routing, and subscriptions amongst other
things; in fact, most of the things in the requirements document
for IMPP [RFC
2779](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2779.txt). Once all the tools support for these specifications
appears, it would be interesting to see how little code would need
to be written to construct an interoperable IM protocol. In the
meantime,
[
Bruce Williams has a blog post describing the WS-Eventing
specification](http://blogs.msdn.com/bwill/archive/2004/02/10/70964.aspx).
