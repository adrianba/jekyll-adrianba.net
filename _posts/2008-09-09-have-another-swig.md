This is mostly a bookmark for me because this isna€™t something I need right now but is definitely something I can see needing in the future. [According to the fine members of the win_tech_off_topic group](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/58515), [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) is a good tool for building the interop layer between C/C++ code and another runtime, be it Java, Python, or .NET.
