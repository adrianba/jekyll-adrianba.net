[
Brad recently blogged](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/004161.shtml) about all the new moves people have been
making and tomorrow I start my new life.

A few months ago, I interviewed for a consulting position at
Microsoft in the UK and gladly accepted when they made me an offer,
so over the last few weeks I've been wrapping up my outstanding
work commitments.

For most of the last 8 years I've been my own boss taking on the
projects I wanted and working in my own way. Transitioning to
working for the largest software company in the world poses great
challenges and also presents huge opportunities and I can't wait to
get my teeth into it. I've met many great people who work at
Microsoft over the last few years and especially at last year's PDC
and I'm looking forward to working as part of a great team.

I will be continuing to maintain my blog as time allows and in
the coming weeks will transfer over to a new domain name. Of
course, I now have to include the obligatory disclaimer for my
posts:
