[Paul Vick](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/)
provides a
[
bit of history](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/PermaLink.aspx/b8439510-534a-4127-9995-ccde06b82d6a) about where the short circuiting logical
operators got their names. One of the projects I'm working on
currently is being written in VB.NET and I have to make a conscious
effort to regularly do a search through my code to replace
`And` and `Or` with `AndAlso` and
`OrElse` since it is rare (never?) that I don't want the
short circuit to be taken if possible.
