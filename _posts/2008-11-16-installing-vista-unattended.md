Ia€™ve been spending some time on a side project to create a Vista boot image that installs unattended and configures a development machine with all the tools I want configured they way I want them. The goal is to install everything including Visual Studio and all the little utilities that I use frequently as well as configuring the common things the way I like them like the mouse sensitivity, colour scheme, etc.

 

The simple starting point for this project is to get Vista to install unattended using an answer file created with the [Windows Automated Installation Kit (Windows AIK)](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc748933.aspx). I found an excellent guide to creating the answer file: [FireGeiera€™s Unattended Vista Guide](http://firegeier.unattended-sponsor.de/en/sitemap.html). This provides a simple walkthrough of how to configure the AIK and how to build increasingly complex unattended installs.
