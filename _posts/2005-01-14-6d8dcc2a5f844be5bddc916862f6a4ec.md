When Microsoft issues service packs for developer tools and
redistributable runtimes or libraries there is usually a knowledge
base article published that lists which previously documented
problems and bugs have been fixed by the service pack (referring to
the KB article describing each issue). These service packs usually
include other fixes that were found internally but that hadn't
necessarily resulted in a public article. It is much less common
for details of these fixes to be made public.

It has been brought to my attention that there are actually two
articles that describe the previously undocumented bugs that were
fixed in both the .NET 1.0 SP3 and the .NET 1.1 SP1 releases:

  * [Information
about undocumented bugs that are fixed in the .NET Framework 1.0
Service Pack 3](http://support.microsoft.com/?id=888527)
  * [List of the
undocumented bugs that are fixed in the .NET Framework 1.1 Service
Pack 1](http://support.microsoft.com/?id=888528)
