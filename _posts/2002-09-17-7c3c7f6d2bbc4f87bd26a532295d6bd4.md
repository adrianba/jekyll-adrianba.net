[
.NET Framework Support on Windows Operating Systems](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/framewkwinsupp.asp). A guide to
the versions of Windows on which the .NET Framework can be
installed, with software requirements, exceptions, and instructions
on preparing applications for cross-platform support.

"The first thing to notice is that the .NET Framework will not
run at all on Windows 95. This is consistent with other
Microsoft® products like Microsoft® Office XP that also
do not support Windows 95."
