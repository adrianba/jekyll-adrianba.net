Note: This is a self extracting exe that expands into another self
extracting exe (named the same), that then extracts to an
installer. The installer then installs 2 files (again the .exe name
is the same)_

from #1. This will ask for your password. Pick the store
explicitly, and pick the "Personal" store._

determine what it's common name (cn) is. You can start certmgr.exe
from IE by Tools->Internet Options, then on the "Content" tab
click the "Certificates..." button_
>   4. _Use signcode.exe as follows (line breaks add for
clarity):  
`signcode.exe  

  -s my  

  -cn "Your Cert CN"  

  -t
http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll  

  "YourFileToSign"`  
  

Note: If you specify the "YourFileToSign" incorrectly you get a
cryptic message: "One or more input parameters are invalid."
instead of a more useful "file not found" message (there's 2 hours
I'll never get back)._

info"._
