[First
Xopus open source release online](http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/2002/09/03.html#a790).
[Sjoerd
Visscher](http://w3future.com/weblog/2002/09/02.html):Â _My colleague at_[_Q42_](http://q42.nl/)_who runs_[_the Xopus project_](http://xopus.org/)_put_[_a stable
release online_](http://xopus.org/index.jsp?menu=downloads)_last friday. There's even some good
documentation in the package! You can start making your XML/XSL
based website editable in the browser right now. Remember, it runs
both in IE and Mozilla._

Very impressive - don't forget you need to install it on a web
server to try the example (note to self: read each line of the
quick install guide not just the one you think is most
important).
