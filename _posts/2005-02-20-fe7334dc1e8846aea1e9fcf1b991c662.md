This post is really a bookmark for me because I regularly seem
to come back to the question of wanting to update environment
variables and trying to remember the windows message to use to
propagate the changes. There is a
[knowledge base
article](http://support.microsoft.com/?id=104011) that covers this, and the message to broadcast is
[
WM_SETTINGCHANGE](http://msdn.com/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/wm_settingchange.asp).
