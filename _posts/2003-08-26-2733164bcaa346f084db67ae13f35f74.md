Brad](http://dotnetguy.techieswithcats.com/archives/003785.shtml) describes using the Application Error event to catch
application-wide exceptions and handle them gracefully. This is
pretty much what I've been doing, although I am just using the code
behind global.asax rather than a separate module for the time
being. My event handler e-mails details of the exception to me
(which allowed me to spot the slight coding error yesterday that
meant a blog post between 201 and 209 characters in length broke my
RSS feed - oops!).
