admin a couple of months now. The SQL Server service caught me the
other day. There's a useful tool in the Win 2000 res kit -
SUBINACL.EXE which allows an admin to delegate permissions to
manage a service to another user. You should then be able to
start/stop the MSSqlserver service manually if required._
