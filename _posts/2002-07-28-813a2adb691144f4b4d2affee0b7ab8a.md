[.NET
Webservice Studio](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/tools/web_svc/default.aspx) is a tool to invoke webmethods interactively.
The user can provide a WSDL endpoint. On clicking button Get the
tool fetches the WSDL, generates .NET proxy from the WSDL and
displays the list of methods available. The user can choose any
method and provide the required input parameters. On clicking
Invoke the SOAP request is sent to the server and the response is
parsed to display the return value.
