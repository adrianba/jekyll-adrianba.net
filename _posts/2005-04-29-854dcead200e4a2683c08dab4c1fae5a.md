There have been some interesting Channel 9 videos recently. The
video with
[Bill
Hill](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=54978) was about 90 minutes long but interesting all the way
through. I cited the
[Rick
Laplante](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=62073) interview the
[
other day](/2005/04/26/ef952c83ee314ae59f04bb5a5ecf4d2e). Today there is an enthralling piece with
[Jim
Allchin](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=63208) about Longhorn and his vision for the Windows
platform.

The thing that I found most interesting was the insight into the
purpose of showing Longhorn at
[WinHEC](http://www.microsoft.com/winhec/). There has
been some disappointment in the press and on the Windows fan sites
about the impression received about Longhorn. As Jim phrased it,
WinHEC wasn't supposed to be a launch party for Longhorn. This show
is targeted at hardware people and in this instance, a large part
was to explain and encourage the new driver models for the next
version of Windows.

I wonder whether it might have been sensible to point this out
before the event rather than afterwards but corporate PR works in
ways beyond my realm of knowledge.
