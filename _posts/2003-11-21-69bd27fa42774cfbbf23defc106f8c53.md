I was trying to remove FrontPage Server Extensions 2002 from the
default virtual web on my Windows Server 2003 install so that I
could install Windows SharePoint Services 2.0.

When I right clicked on the web and selected Remove Server
Extensions from the tasks menu, I got an error "Microsoft FrontPage
Server Extensions. Server extensions administration port not
found."

For some reason, the admin port wasn't set but according to

`owsadm` tool from `C:Program FilesCommon
FilesMicrosoft Sharedweb server extensions50bin`:

To check current admin port type: `owsadm -o
getadminport`  

To change admin port type: `owsadm -o setadminport -p
8888` where 8888 is a port number.
