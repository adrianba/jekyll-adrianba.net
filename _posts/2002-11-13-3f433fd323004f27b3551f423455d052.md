[
The Law of Leaky Abstractions](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html).
[[Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/)]

<blockquote>_"Ten years ago, we might have imagined that new programming
paradigms would have made programming easier by now."Â 
"...when you need to hire a programmer to do mostly VB programming,
it's not good enough to hire a VB programmer, because they will get
completely stuck in tar every time the VB abstraction
leaks."_
