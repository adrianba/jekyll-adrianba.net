[How
To Make Google Your Browser Default Search Engine](http://www.google.com/options/defaults.html#default)

I spent some time looking for this - it isn't the complete
solution: I still don't know how to make Internet Explorer search
Google using autosearch - there is some mention on UsenetÂ of
selecting "Google Sites" in the customise box, but I don't have
that option.
