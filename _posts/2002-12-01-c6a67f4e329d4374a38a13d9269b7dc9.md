[Managed
and Unmanaged Contexts](http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/archives/000185.html).

<blockquote>_What exactly is the relation, and the interactions between,
unmanaged and managed contexts?_ Now, I do know the basics, but
not much more. Managed contexts are very undocumented, and I'm not
sure I know much about them (I'd particularly like to understand
when and why they are created by the runtime), but how they relate
to unmanaged contexts is even more misterious (to me, at
least).
> 
> So, for example, as I understand it, a
ContextBoundObject-derived object will be bound to a managed
context, while a ServicedComponent-derived object is furthermore
constrained to be bound to an unmanaged COM+ context. However,
that's doesn't say all that much. For example, is there always a
managed context for every unmanaged context? Or can an unmanaged
context contain multiple managed contexts? Or are managed
ContextBoundObject-derived objects _context-agile_ with
respect to unmanaged contexts?

I found this document the other day when looking for Enterprise
Services context related stuff:

<blockquote>[Understanding
Enterprise Services in .NET](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/xmlentsvcs/espaper.aspx)

It talks about the contexts and how they relate to unmanaged
COM(+) stuff.
