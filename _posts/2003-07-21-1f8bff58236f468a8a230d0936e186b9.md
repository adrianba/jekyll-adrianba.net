After what I wrote
[
yesterday](/2003-07-20), I came across PaulV's
[
comments](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/PermaLink.aspx/59c6b236-ebf8-4cd8-86d7-142008781f6e) on the same subject:

<blockquote>_So, in the end, I think the whole "C# vs VB"
argument is a non-starter. The real question is: are we doing a
good job making your life easier? Are we the best tool for
developers out there? That's the important thing and what we focus
on every day._</blockquote>
