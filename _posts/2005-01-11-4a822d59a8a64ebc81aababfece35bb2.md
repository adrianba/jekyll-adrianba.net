[Simon
Fell points](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2004/11/1499.html) to an
[article](http://www.sforce.com/resources/tn-8.jsp)
showing how to add HTTP 1.1 compression support to a .NET web
service client proxy.

[
Yasser Shohoud reports](http://blogs.msdn.com/Yassers/archive/2004/11/10/255212.aspx) that "_IIS 6.0 makes it easy to
compress replies including Web services replies. In .NET 2.0, the
client will automatically tell the server that it accepts gzip
compression and it will automatically decompress replies. [...]
Note that we don't have a client side compression feature so if you
are sending Base64 data **from the client** and you
want to compress it, you would need to use 3rd party compression
library or roll your own._" (emphasis mine)
