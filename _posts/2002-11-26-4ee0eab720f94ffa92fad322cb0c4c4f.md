[[DOTNET-CLR](http://discuss.develop.com/dotnet-clr.html)]
on specifying GAC assemblies in .config files: 


<blockquote>_...a change made during the beta timeframe started requiring
you to use a fully specified strong name for such assemblies in
your config files. So (for example) something like
<channel
type="System.Runtime.Remoting.HttpChannel, System.Runtime.Remoting"
/> no longer cuts it; you need to use <channel
type="System.Runtime.Remoting.HttpChannel, System.Runtime.Remoting,
Version=blah, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=blah"
/>_
> 
> </blockquote>

This doesn't seem to be particularly well documented in MSDN.
The examples I've recently been looking at relating to ASP.NET
don't include the version, culture, and publickeytoken attributes
and so this explains the difficulties I was having.

I'm not sure if there is a better method, but it seems like the
way to lookup the values for version, etc. is to browse to
[C:WINDOWSassembly](file:///c:/windows/assembly)Â where
you can see the assemblies in the GAC together with their
attributes.
