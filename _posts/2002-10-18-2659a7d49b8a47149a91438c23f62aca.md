I've been moving my site to a different provider over the last
couple of days. I'm using
[webhost4life.com](http://www.webhost4life.com/default.asp?refid=vtweb)
because they include ASP.NET hosting and a SQL Server 2000
database, which I want for some current projects. Prices seem
reasonable too. Anyhow, if this works then I've got it set-up and
working with Radio.
