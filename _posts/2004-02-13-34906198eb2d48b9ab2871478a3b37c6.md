Despite my initial scepticism, and what I consider to be a lack
of direction from Microsoft about how best to utilise InfoPath,
I've been bitten by the InfoPath bug after the past couple of
months or so and we're using it as the central forms engine on one
of the projects I'm currently involved with.

As I think everyone probably does, I did wonder about the lack
of a runtime-only version of InfoPath. After all, there are viewers
for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and I think Visio. You can use the Jet
database engine to read .MDB files. But if viewing is all you want,
you can use the files InfoPath creates - they are using standards
formats like XSLT and XSD. LauraJ has the
