[Open
Source IE Web Controls](http://aspnetweblog.com/archive/02042003.aspx#364). 


Microsoft recently released
the[
IE Web Controls](http://www.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=7&tabid=41) open source, which I think was a very cool
move. I can't wait to start adding some new functionality to the
controls and fixing some of the bugs.
