Microsoft UK are running a free technical briefing in Reading
next week with members of the C++ product team coming over to
present. They're keen to speak to C++ developers about the new
compilers, improved VS2005 environment, and the new MFC and ATL
classes. There will also be several developer evangelists from
Microsoft UK present so it should be a good networking event. It
should be a small audience event with plenty of opportunity to quiz
the product team about their plans.

**[
MSDN Technical Briefing: Visual C++ Accelerator Tour (Level
200)](https://msevents-eu.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-GB&eventid=118757466)  
**22 April 2005 09:30 - 17:00 - Reading  
  

You will learn about improvements to developer productivity in the
Whidbey (2005) release, ways to make your application more secure,
increase performance, mix native and managed code, and upgrade from
prior versions of the Visual C++ compiler. You will gain a clear
understanding of Microsoft's direction and ongoing commitment to
provide the best tools for C++ developers.

Richard Howells brought to my attention](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/39367) that this coincides
with the
[ACCU
conference in Oxford](http://www.accu.org/conference/highlights.html) next week.

To help provide some differentiation, the agenda for the MSDN
briefing will be:

One of my colleagues added:

<blockquote>_There's bound to be some overlap between what gets said at
ACCU by the C++ product team and what gets said at Reading on the
Friday but ACCU looks to be more on the "academic" side of the
languages whereas the TVP event looks to be more on the "tools"
side of things with VS 2005 and so on._

> _If you're going to ACCU then you get to meet those guys at
that conference. If there's a worry that by being at ACCU on the
Friday you're missing the Reading sessions then there are some
online versions of these kinds of materials at places like:_

All in all, it looks to be a good event so please
