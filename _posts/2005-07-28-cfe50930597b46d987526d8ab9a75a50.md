From the
[Internet
Explorer 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/IE/ie7/default.mspx) site:

<blockquote>_The first stage of the beta process for Internet
Explorer 7 has begunâ€”developer testing! The latest version of
the worldâ€™s most popular Web browser has been released for
technical evaluation, feedback, and testing by software and Web
site developers._</blockquote>

<blockquote>_The Beta 1 release signals that Internet Explorer 7
has reached an important milestone, with a number of key new
features and improvements, and is ready for website and application
compatibility testing. This release is specifically intended for
developers to confirm that existing applications and websites will
work well with Internet Explorer 7, and provides an opportunity for
developers to give feedback directly to the development team. There
will be further refinement between Beta 1 and the final
version._</blockquote>
