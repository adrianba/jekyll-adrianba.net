[
Jeff Smith](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/21170): _There is a
[webalizer port
for Win32](http://www.medasys-lille.com/webalizer/). Works great. Make sure you turn off the built in
reverse DNS lookup or it will take days to analyze any decent size
logfile. Also make sure you go into IIS and turn on logging for
Referrer, User Agent, and Bytes Sent because those are usually
turned off and that's important info!_
