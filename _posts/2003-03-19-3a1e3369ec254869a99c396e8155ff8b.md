I'm running Outlook 2003 B2 and I have a problem using VBA if my
account doesn't have administrator access (maybe power user but I
only tried admin). If I try to access any of the items on the
Macros menu, nothing happens. If I add myself to the Administrators
group then everything works as expected. I upgraded from Office XP
and I could run macros fine with that. I've tried uninstalling VBA
and reinstalling and then uninstalling the whole of Office and
reinstalling but to no avail. I don't really want to go back to
running with admin rights but there are a couple of macros I use
regularly that I don't really want to live without. I can load VBA
fine from, say, Word.
