Interesting to see an NUnit task demonstrated in the MSBuild
presentation. They also explained how they see a distinction
between NAnt and MSBuild in a polite fashion (I think they're
basically saying that MSBuild will be thicker and much more closely
integrated with the platform, but my take is that in fact it's
probably just going to be simpler for the average developer because
it will be integrated into Visual Studio).

Anyway, I thought these Microsoft boys weren't allowed to go
anywhere near Open Source?
