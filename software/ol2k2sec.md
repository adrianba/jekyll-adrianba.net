From Microsoft's knowledge base ([Q290497](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q290497)):

> _Outlook 2002 includes a new security feature that blocks attachments considered unsafe. If you receive an e-mail message that contains one of the blocked file types, you may see the following warning message:_
> 
> _Outlook blocked access to the following potentially unsafe attachments: [...]_
> 
> _Although access to the attachment has been blocked, the attachment still exists in the message._

The article goes on to explain how to manipulate the registry to allow access to these attachments. This applet does that for you.
