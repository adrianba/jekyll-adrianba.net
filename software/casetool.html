<H1>Preaching to the Converted?</H1>

<P>You know how it is.</P>

<P>Your favourite graphics program saves your files with a .GIF
extension, and your web pages link to .gif files. And you've
just done a batch conversion of 30 product shots ready to ftp to the server...</P>

<P>Your designer uses a Mac and saves everything in upper case.
Your web server is case sensitive, and you don't want to use upper case...</P>

<P>You've just unpacked an archive of data files from all over the World,
and the files are mixed cases. The program that reads them wants them in upper case only...</P>

<P>There's only one thing for it - you're gonna have to rename them
<STRONG>all</STRONG> by hand.</P>

<H2><IMG SRC="CaseTool.gif" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=175 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right HSPACE=10>Don't you just hate that?</H2>
