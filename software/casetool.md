## Preaching to the Converted?

You know how it is.

Your favourite graphics program saves your files with a .GIF extension, and your web pages link to .gif files. And you've just done a batch conversion of 30 product shots ready to ftp to the server...

Your designer uses a Mac and saves everything in upper case. Your web server is case sensitive, and you don't want to use upper case...

You've just unpacked an archive of data files from all over the World, and the files are mixed cases. The program that reads them wants them in upper case only...

There's only one thing for it - you're gonna have to rename them **all** by hand.

## ![](/software/CaseTool.gif)Don't you just hate that?

So do we, so we've created **CaseTool** - the drag 'n' drop filename case converter for Windows!

**CaseTool** couldn't be easier to use. Simply select the files you wish to convert, drag 'n' drop them onto **CaseTool** and voila! Their names are converted!

Want to convert from UPPER to lower? Right-click on **CaseTool** and the conversion direction is reversed!
