title: "Samsung Smart Switch - How to install on Windows 10"
---
**Samsung Smart Switch** is a tool that will backup your phone and transfer the data to a new Samsung
phone. You also use it to backup your phone to your PC in case you need to restore it later.

You can find [Samsung Smart Switch for Mac or PC](http://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00048603/)
on the Samsung site. The PC version has a dependency on some relatively old versions of the Visual
C++ runtime, which you may not have installed on a newer PC running Windows 10.

You need to install both the x86 and x64 versions of the runtime:

* [Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582)
 
* [Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092)

I had managed to install enough apps on my phone that some of them
were causing some performance problems (one of the challenges
I've found with Android). I had decided to back-up my phone, do a
factory reset and then restore things like photos and text
messages, but install the apps that I wanted from scratch.

It seemed like Smart Switch was a good tool for this. One hiccup
was that the program doesn't appear to have a way to do a partial
restore. I had backed up everything on my phone and, when I
did the restore, it put everything back the way it had been. Great
verification of the back-up/restore process but not exactly what I
wanted in this instance.

I had to do a new backup with only the data items that I wanted to
restore selected in the preferences. After a second factory reset,
this time the restore did exactly what I wanted and I set about
restoring the apps I use often from my Google Play store library.
