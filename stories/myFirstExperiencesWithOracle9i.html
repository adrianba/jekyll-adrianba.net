<h1>My first experiences with Oracle 9i</h1>

<p>Now I never really found Oracle very easy to get into and I didn't like their sales pitch to me which&nbsp;boiled down to that &nbsp;"...you should use Oracle because everyone worth worrying about does...". Strangely, this didn't quite have the intended effect.</p>
<p>I've been trying to think back to when I started using SQL Server 6.5 and I really don't remember it being so difficult but I recognise that memory has a habit of tricking you like that.</p>
<p>So this weekend, I decided to bite the bullet and try again with Oracle 9i. At work, I deal with a variety of different customers and some of them do like to work with Oracle so I figure I have to make allowances and getting more of a handle on Oracle would be a Good Thing.</p>
<p>I'm still a bit confused though. First off, I went through the installation procedure trying to install the minimum amount of software so that I'd have a database and the admin tools to work with it (I already have a web server, etc. and I want to code against it with ADO or .NET so I don't need an extensive Java based application server thing). This used about 1.3GB of space on my disk (my SQL Server installation is about 180MB) which was a bit of a surprise, but I'll be the last person to deny that Microsoft also manage to produce bloatware.</p>
<p>What really shocked me was that&nbsp;creating what I hoped was a minimal database with the Database Configuration Assistant was far from easy&nbsp;- I didn't really understand what was happening. To top it all, though, it used another 1GB of my disk to make an almost empty database.</p>
<p>What did I do wrong? Okay, I know hard disk space is supposed to be cheap these days, but why does it need <em>so</em> much?</p>
